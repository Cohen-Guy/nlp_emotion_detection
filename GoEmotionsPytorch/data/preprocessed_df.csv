no,4,4,3,2,1,3,3,Asiana Airlines,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,2022,8,A380,,,HKG,ICN,,True," Hong Kong to Seoul with Asiana Airlines. My window was dirty, my headrest and my pillow covers were not changed (covers in fabric so passengers cannot always notice it, but the smell was just terrible. The blanket was the one used for the previous flight (just folded on the seat, not sealed in a plastic bag as it should be). When I asked for a ""clean blanket"" the FA did not really seem to realize what I meant. Extremely disappointed by these kind of practices. I usually have issues with Asiana regarding dirty windows so I usually ask the FA a wet tissue to clean it. When traveling on a legacy airline, cleanliness is an issue for me, since it's basic respect for passengers. By comparison, I flew Korean Air several times and never had such issues. Take off at 00:40 and ""dinner"" served at 2am. Seriously, the only things passengers want to do at this time is to sleep. FA woke up all the passengers by asking them to put up their seats. Choice was not appropriate - porridge or sea food. I did not take any of them. A breakfast, before arriving at Incheon would have been more suitable. The quantity of movies loaded in the IFE is just a huge joke. The movie application is divided into themes and in Hollywood or classics you would find only have 3 to 4 movies."
yes,8,4,5,3,4,3,4,Cathay Pacific Airways,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,2022,11,A330,,,Hong Kong,Melbourne,,,"Hong Kong to Melbourne. Seat 32G, last row aisle seat in the premium economy cabin. It seems seats in the last row in PE have better recline than the other two rows. Seats arranged in 2x3x2 configuration. Seat with foot rest, fairly comfortable with good recline. PE cabin completely full. Shared bathrooms with economy cabin. IFE screens good size maybe 11 or 12 inches seem a little larger than iPad. Good contents plenty to watch to kill time. Cabin clean and tidy, bathrooms kept fully stocked and clean. Flight scheduled to depart Hong Kong at 10:20 AM but delayed to 10:35 AM and finally departed after 11am. Arrived into Melbourne after 11pm about 40 minutes late. Pre departure drinks offered but no champagne only water and juices. Hot towel offered only once be nice to have another hot towel service prior to arrival. Once airborne lunch service began. Pre ordered vegetarian meal and served first but after finished with meal stuck with tray for the next hour as cabin crew was serving the rest of the economy cabin before returning to clear trays. Drinks offered multiple times. A male cabin crew addressed passengers by name and introduced himself, very pleasant and professional. Pre arrival meals served two hours before landing. Overall an above average flight with friendly and professional cabin crew. Only minor complaint Cathay Pacific does not know the different between vegan and vegetarian meals. If you order vegetarian meal chances are you will get a vegan meal of pasta with salad and no dressing for main meal and some sort of greasy grilled vegetables with soggy potato wedges as pre landing meal. Recommend CX provides salad dressing and a second hot towel service."
no,2,1,2,1,3,1,2,Norwegian,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,2022,10,787,,,LGW,BOS,,,"Flew Norwegian from London Gatwick to Boston. My first time on a no frills airline. The air was slightly better on a 787, but the crowded plane in economy with no meal (I didn't pre-order the relatively high priced meal service) made the flight seem almost endless. The ticket price was good, but I think if I need to save that much money I would prefer to just stay home. There is no lumbar support in the seats and the planes were full. I never got comfortable in the 7 plus hours."
yes,9,5,5,5,5,5,4,Singapore Airlines,Family Leisure,Business Class,2022,2,A350-900,,,Singapore,Amsterdam,,True," Service is unparalleled. Food is very good and served on proper plates with real cutlery. Wide selection of online shopping. Best thing about this flight was the sky bed. The chair unfolds into a flat bed, which gave my son and I some decent sleep. The plane leaves SG just before midnight and arrives in AMS around 6.15am - so even a 12 hour flight seems like no time is wasted. Wifi is available on board but requires payment. The complimentary allowance for business class members is only suited for text messages - runs out fast. Overall, a very comfortable flight. Will definitely fly again."

Seats were nice, entertainment was fairly good and food delicious. Landed at 7am and generally found it a pleasant flight. However when I departed from the UK with Boeing 777-300ER Manchester to Abu Dhabi I found seat pitch pretty tight and slightly uncomfortable. Next time will probably try Qatar Airways or Emirates."
no,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,Ethiopian Airlines,Family Leisure,Economy Class,2022,6,777-200LR,,,Paris,Johannesburg,Addis Ababa,True," Paris to Johannesburg via Addis Ababa with Ethiopian Airlines. A chaotic check in experience for a packed flight at CDG. Boarding was supposed to be via zone, but when boarding time came at CDG it was every man for himself. Basically it was organized chaos. Passengers boarded with hand luggage that did not fit into the overhead compartments, and I ended up helping the cabin crew repack the compartments to fit everything in, as I am quite tall. The flight from CDG to ADD was the noisiest, smelliest flight I have ever been on, and 4 hours into the 6.5 hour journey, I wanted to use the toilet. The floor and toilet was covered in urine and toilet paper. I reported this to the cabin crew and nothing was done about it. The interior was the the most tired and dated I have been on, and my inflight entertainment was working on and off. Food service was abysmal, and after service the crew disappeared for the rest of the flight. The aircraft was quite dirty and one of the overhead bins opened in ADD when we were slammed into the ground upon landing. The leg from ADD to JNB was also in a 777-200LR, but on the upside it was quite empty. Meal service on this leg was a snack and a lunch and from all the meals this was passable. Service in general was OK, but nothing to rave about. In general the whole Ethiopian experience left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I would suggest that the airline focus on customer service, and do something to fix abysmal ADD airport before they consider expanding further. A more modern cabin refresh wouldn't hurt either."
yes,8,4,4,4,5,4,4,Air New Zealand,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,2022,1,A320,,,CHC,BNE,,True," NZ805 Christchurch to Brisbane. I consider this flight an excellent choice for having sufficient time in the morning in Christchurch to have brunch with family before flying home. Check in effortless at Christchurch Airport. Made use of Koru Lounge prior to boarding with Koru membership. Boarding quick. Aircraft perhaps 85% full. Once loaded, an unexpected 30 minute delay occurred. However, flight landed in Brisbane 15 minutes early. The only male flight attendant presented as disinterested, appearing unhappy and 'going through the motions.' Female flight attendants were positively engaged in their occupation. Food offerings consisted of two hot meals for 'The Works' passengers. The beef, rice and vegetable option was tasty enough for airline food. However portion small. It has been noted on a number of Air New Zealand flights taken recently that soft drinks are not served by the can, but rather out of the can and into the plastic cup by the flight attendants. While innocent in service to passengers, this is portion control by any description and therefore Air New Zealand cost cutting. I have also noticed that when the Customer Service Manager reads the offerings out across the PA, there is no mention of soft drinks, only tea, coffee and water. Bags out on belt within 15 minutes at Brisbane Airport. While I consider Air New Zealand to be a good airline, they pale in comparison to Qantas with service delivery. Overall a good flight, but Air New Zealand let themselves down with these issues."

Comfortable seating, good choice of breakfast food and beverages. Boarding was a bit of a mess. Seating on A320 was 3x3 with middle seat free. Ample leg room and reading material. Cabin crew polite but a little cold. Booked a vegetarian meal, was presented with vegetable curry and rice 30 minutes after take off. Although grateful, had to return untouched as expected something a little different. A320 from Zurich to Athens the cabin crew, although polite, were a little aloof and cold. Lunch an Asian vegetarian meal which was tasty. Usual wines and soft drinks followed by little squares of Swiss chocolate. Cabin announcements by Purser made in German, French and English were too lengthy, loud and annoying. Landed 20 minutes early. Overall, a good experience."
yes,6,4,5,4,1,1,5,American Airlines,Business,Economy Class,2022,11,767-300,,,Miami,LA,,,"My previous experiences with American Airlines was not so good, but this one flight compensated it all. The flight attendants were well dressed, friendly, and professional. I heard food on American Airlines is expensive, but I still bought the Asian Chicken Wrap and it was worth the price I paid. Before touching down at LA I got sick, and somehow managed to walk to the galley and despite her restriction, the flight attendant managed to get me a bottle of water and I am grateful to her for that. The flight was 3/4 full, so I went to the two empty seats at the back and rested all the way to LA, the seats were comfortable, and the plane seemed new though some seats were worn and torn. I am still not sure if I may fly this airline again because of how bad the experiences were, of the 4 flights I had with American, this one was the only one which was satisfactory."

Paris CDG to Washington flight left 1 hr late causing me to miss my connection in IAD. I monitored this flight for 30 days and the majority of the time it is late. However, the inflight service was great. Cabin crew were professional, polite and very efficient, service was great. Food left a lot to be desired. The description ""airline food"" was justified on this flight, a little disappointing. Seat comfort was fine for me since I don't like to raise my feet from the floor. All in all it was a pretty good flight."

I intend to post to this site every time I fly United. The comments will not only be made when I have a negative experience, which I hope is the case, but here we are again with a 90 minute flight home.

First time on China Southern Airlines and a fantastic experience. I fly Canada to South Asia 3-4 times a year. This time I travelled with my two adult daughters and my 7 month grandson. We had a scheduled layover in Guangzhou on the return and were put in a great hotel and had breakfast there. We also had the same flight crew both ways and they were helping out with the baby and checking many times during the 13 hrs flight.
yes,7,4,4,4,1,4,3,Copa Airlines,Solo Leisure,Business Class,2022,4,737,,,PTY,BOG,,True, Panama to Bogota with Copa Airlines. A short 1 hour 10 minutes flight. Departures from Tocumen Airport at a very punctual schedule. Ground staff was kind. Staff at call center for Connect Miles program is helpful and knowledgeable. Business class is pretty basic. Seats are comfortable but they don't have foot rest and onboard entertainment system is very poor. Food was good and wine selection ok.

I found the FAs to be both professional and warm. Being acknowledged as a Velocity Gold member of Virgin Australia (Etihad's Partner airline) upon boarding by being offered a welcome drink and having my meal order taken prior to take-off, a nice touch. I found the food to be above average and the seats to be comfortable especially along side the pillows which have the option of being split to reshape as flight pillow. IFE was in the form in-seat touch screen sets that worked well and had a number of the latest movies and tv series. Overall a great set of flights."
no,1,3,1,1,1,4,3,United Airlines,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,2022,12,A319,,,LGA,YVR,ORD,True," New York La Guardia to Vancouver via Chicago. The New York to Chicago flight was nice trip and bumpy so service was suspended for safety reasons. Chicago to Vancouver a nasty air crew looking to upset customers. We sat in the third row or first of premium economy. We were ordered shortly after take off not to congregate or line up for toilets in the rear. Since we were up front making it to the toilet without anyone getting in front of you was impossible. Due to this fact I did not drink on aircraft as at 65 it can be painful to wait. We were offered no food as promised for our two hungry boys. They did get a third of a can of Sprite as this was their second long flight they asked for another drink of Sprite. They were refused. My wife asked for water instead politely. I asked for the purser to request an additional sprite as United advertises complimentary beverages. He did deliver. I thanked him profusely but now I was unbeknownst to me a marked man. I sat quietly until I was in dire need of a toilet. There were eight people in first class all sitting comfortably so I quickly used the front toilet. You would think I had threatened the aircraft. When I exited I was berated and demeaned by that same purser and ordered back to my seat. Where else I would go at 36,000 feet in the air was a mystery to me. I complied without incident. I did tell him quietly before landing he was a rude man for embarrassing me for using a toilet. On arrival the pilot came bounding out of the cockpit and had requested security at the gate. A toilet offense had apparently endangered the aircraft in some ridiculous fashion. He proceeded to lie about me talking to staff which had not happened. I was accused of blocking the aisle which had not happened. The security personnel dismissed the incident and we all went home. United is not passenger friendly and rather than attack or correct complaints they attack the complainer."
no,3,1,4,4,5,3,3,Jetblue Airways,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,2022,4,A320,,,Fort Lauderdale,Newark,,False," Fort Lauderdale to Newark. I have always liked this airline, However, this particular flight was a disaster! I always book my ticket noting my Global ID number. On this flight not only was my Global ID number NOT on my ticket, in addition it did not designate an extra leg room seat. As a result I missed out on a seat up front putting me in a window Exit seat which does not recline. It would have been a nice gesture if the ticket agent had told me that fact."
no,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,Pegasus Airlines,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,2022,8,737,,,Tiblisi,Madrid,Istanbul,,"If you expect warm friendly service this is not the airline for you. I mean not even a smile in the 2 flights I took. I saw a boarding passenger asking a flight attendant to point out where he was seating and she just gave him a dirty look. Overall the flights were ok, 30 min delay on both flight which seems to be the norm. I guess they manage to get you from A to B without any kind of style. Nothing compared to TK."
yes,10,4,5,4,3,4,4,United Airlines,Solo Leisure,Business Class,2022,6,B737 A319,,,Houston,Boston,,True," Flew Houston - Boston and return last week with United Airlines. Both flight were on time, both flights had great service and friendly helpful staff. Is there room for improvement? Of course there is, but this time I'm not complaining. B737 and return A319 were clean and crew were excellent. I came in late on Icelandair on my way back and had to run from E to B in BOS and the staff member at the United desk did save my day by issuing my boarding pass and guided me to security so I made my flight back to Houston."

Good flights, great crew, attentive, approachable, Meals great, drinks plentiful, alcoholic and juices, water, tea, coffee etc, A bit rough flying over Australia, captain had seat belt sign on several times, as well as announcements from cabin crew, Very safety conscience. Clean toilets, rubbish removed promptly. A great experience, would fly this top rating airline again."

The standard and quantity of food offered has dropped. Staff work very hard, are intelligent and friendly. I found the aircraft to be dated, and the inflight entertainment quite limited. The aircraft was spotless, but again the 70's interior feel, and the lack of a decent IFE offer was disappointing. It reminds of the flights I took in the 90's. The seat was comfortable and the leg room was adequate. The second leg to Samui was a standard quick hop from Singapore with a superior plane and staff."
yes,9,5,5,3,5,4,4,Emirates,Family Leisure,Economy Class,2022,8,777-300ER,,,Bengaluru,Dammam,Dubai,True, Had a really good experience flying with Emirates from Bengaluru to Dammam via Dubai. Both flights were on time. The aircraft used on the BLR-DXB sector was a bit old. The entertainment was amazing but the touch screen was not responsive. The food was not that good to be frank and the cabin crew were very friendly. They gave toys for kids and had special food for them. Flight landed on time but we were parked away from the terminal and the bus took around 30 minutes to arrive at the aircraft. Since I had 5 hrs layover it was not a problem for me. The aircraft used on the DXB-DMM sector was a brand new aircraft and this aircraft was much better than the previous one. The screens were much larger and they were very responsive unlike the previous one but could not do much since it was only a 45 minute flight. The sandwich served was awful. Crew communication on both the sectors was really good and I would love to fly with Emirates again.
no,2,2,2,1,1,2,1,Sunwing Airlines,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,2022,3,737,,,Edmonton,Varadero,,False," Iâ€™ll start with the flight. Our flight took off at 5:45pm and we landed in Cuba after 1am. We paid extra for the elite plus package. The 3rd row we had on the way down was ideal. We got the first row on the way back, it was the worst, you couldnâ€™t move the arm rest and itâ€™s annoying to have no place to put your bags. On the way down, we had a rowdy, loud couple who never stopped talking. It was annoying until around 11pm and just ignorant after that as it would have been nice to have a little nap given we werenâ€™t getting to our hotel until 3-4am. The flight attendants did nothing to get them to be quiet, rather, they participated in the shenanigans. If I had my kids with me, I would have been extremely upset. On the way back, the same couple was on the plane and were still talking the whole way home. We left Cuba after 3am so everyone wanted to sleep and these people never shut up. Again, no one from sunwing said anything to them. Grow a back bone for your other passengers flight comfort and say something to these people please! As for the resort, it was amazing. However, Sunwing was paid by us for a 7 day stay. We really got more like 6 and a few hours because of the time our flight came in. I would recommend you ask Sunwing about this. Our check in time for our resort was 3pm March 2nd. We hadnâ€™t even left Edmonton until 5:45pm that same day. Our flight home was at 3:35am on March 10th. We had to vacate our room at 12pm on March 9th meaning we had no room to stay in for 11 hours before the bus came to take us to the airport. When we spoke to the resort, they said sometimes when Sunwing does this, they pay for the room or negotiate late check out. They did nothing of the sort. The resort however took care of us and we checked out at 4pm and were offered a courtesy room in case we wanted to freshen up before the flight. That was 100% because we spoke to a wonderful man named Oscar who helps run the resort. When I went to the front desk, they basically said thatâ€™s what sunwing paid for so if we hadnâ€™t found Oscar, we would have been screwed. Iâ€™ve stayed once in Cuba before and had the exact same flight situation but we got to keep our room until we left. This is why I will book through that company in the future. Iâ€™ve had so many issues with Sunwing that I havenâ€™t booked with them in 4 years and I never will again. Theyâ€™re the worst!"
yes,10,5,5,5,5,5,5,Qatar Airways,Family Leisure,Economy Class,2022,1,A350,,,Edinburgh,Lahore,Doha,True," Edinburgh to Lahore via Doha. Best airline. Absolutely brilliant, great helpful staff. The meals served were fantastic and the A350 is a very comfortable and modern plane to travel in."
no,5,4,2,4,4,3,2,Emirates,Solo Leisure,Business Class,2022,11,A380,,,Christchurch,Bangkok,Sydney,True, A disappointing experience. Flew with Emirates on the A380 from Christchurch to Sydney. Had high expectations from my previous flight. Emirates have a fantastic hard product on the A380. Great spacious seat and fantastic entertainment systems. The food onboard the flight was great with a great selection of onboard beverages and well-presented meals. I was very disappointed by the crew and received dull and uninterested service. The staff seemed to have no interest in the guests traveling. The service was efficient but cold. Certainly room for improvement for a so-called leading airline. I would not recommend Emirates if traveling in business class. There are alternative airlines that with great products and personalized service where you will have a more well rounded experience.
no,2,4,4,4,4,1,2,Aer Lingus,Couple Leisure,Business Class,2022,11,A330,,,Los Angeles,Dublin,,True," Los Angeles to Dublin. We initially booked economy round trip for 2 and added assigned seats, baggage fees, upgraded meals and lounge access. The added fees for seats, bags, meals and lounge totaled $551. During the online booking a passenger middle name was place into the last name field, Aer Lingus charged $157 to correct it. We subsequently self upgraded to Business Class which includes normally includes everything we paid additional fees for. Aer Lingus refused to refund the additional fees, stating that was their policy. Also the outbound flight was delayed over 3 hours and my bag was lost on the return trip and took 1 week for it to be delivered even though my name and phone number and address were on my bag. Telephone customer service is almost non-existent, everything has to be processed through their web site. In flight service and comfort good is but before and after the flight is terrible."
no,2,3,3,1,1,2,2,Sunwing Airlines,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,2022,7,737-800,,,Vancouver,Toronto,,True," Flew Vancouver to Toronto with Sunwing. All fine print/policy needs to be reviewed with this airline, there are fees for everything. They will sell you tickets with lower prices than the competition then charge you for your carry-on. This makes the cost a little more expensive than other airlines. Plane was 1.5 hour delayed. Staff are friendly, some are smarmy. They just seem to care about your money. No free onboard entertainment. Food is costly and below average. Their staff and policy needs some human touch. I felt cheated and ripped off."

Brand new Qatar Airways Boeing 777-300ER on the MCT-DOH leg and an elderly A330-200 between Doha and Ho Chi Minh City. The 777 seats are just fabulous! The A330 was equipped with the older seats which stretch out fully but stay slightly inclined. I was a bit disappointed at first but then noticed that the angle was not to bad. I could sleep very well without sliding down. Food and beverages were of excellent quality throughout, including in the new very large business lounge in DOH. The cabin crew was friendly, always available and helpful but never obtrusive. Check-in swift both in MCT and SGN. I would fly Qatar Airways again."

We departed and arrived on time and the price for this trip was excellent. Very comfortable seat, but they have no bassinet services for infants. Crew very attentive and friendly. Meal was delicious. Inflight entertainment was very good."
yes,7,3,3,4,4,4,4,British Airways,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,2022,1,A320, A380, 777-300,WAW,HKG,LHR,,The British Airways outbound flight from London to Hong Kong was on a 3 year old A380. We sat near the back on the upper deck and were very pleased with how comfortable and smooth it was. On the upper deck there is a cupboard by the window seat which gives more space to put your coats and also doubles up as a shelf to put your drinks. The 5 year old Boeing 777 on the return leg was far more cramped. Also the video screen was faulty and it was difficult to click on the screen. The crew on all flights were fine but nothing special. Just performed their job but never really seemed to go out of their way.
no,1,1,2,1,1,2,1,flydubai,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,2022,2,737-800MAX,,,Dubai,Zanzibar,,False," We had booked a return flight with Emirates, from Glasgow to Zanzibar via Dubai on 27th February and returning on 7th March. After confirming our booking, we found that the 6 hour leg from Dubai to Zanzibar is operated by FlyDubai, which turns out to be a low cost (but not particularly cheap) airline. The Emirates flights to and from Glasgow to Dubai on a 777-300 were excellent in all respects but we can honestly say that in all our years of travelling, the FlyDubai flights in a Boeing 737-800MAX were probably the worst we have ever taken. By booking with Emirates, we not unreasonably expected to get at least a roughly comparable standard of service and amenities. We believe that Emirates should make it clearer when booking that an associated connecting flight is operated by a budget airline, and a poor one at that. There were so many things wrong that itâ€™s difficult to know where to start but here goes: The seats were really very cramped, with a nominal pitch of 30â€ but I suspect that in reality itâ€™s a bit less than this. Furthermore, the seats were quite hard and our backsides started to suffer after a couple of hours. Theyâ€™ve tried to cram in as many passengers as possible and whilst this may be just bearable for short haul flights, itâ€™s a disgrace to use this configuration for what was a long haul flight. It was obvious that many passengers, and more especially the taller ones, were really suffering. The aisle was very narrow, and passengers in aisle seats were being constantly bumped into while trying to sleep. The cabin on both the outbound and return flights was terribly stuffy and airless. Air con was either not working properly, or not set up correctly. People were asking for water but had to pay for it! Absolutely disgraceful! As we were on an Emirates ticket, we were entitled to complimentary meals, but other passengers had to pay. The meals were truly awful and pretty much inedible. In flight entertainment is available but has to be paid for, even for those on an Emirates ticket. FlyDubai operates from Terminal 2 which entails a painfully slow 40 minute bus transfer from Terminal 3 â€“ this is pretty nail-biting if you have a tight connection, as we did. All in all, a horrible experience that we never wish to repeat and we can categorically state that we will never use FlyDubai again, and nor will we book with Emirates if they use them for connecting flights. There are better alternatives."

Managed to switch seats to one with a bit more legroom, the one I initially was assigned to was a bit cramped (and I am not that tall) with some kind of PSU taking up valuable space under the seat in front of me. Nice, hard working and friendly cabin crew. The food was very poor. Some kind of bland pork with rice, cold noodles and some green tea pudding. Being situated in the back of the aircraft they had ran out of options when it was my turn, but I doubt the other choice were any better. Second dish was even worse. Some fried rice balls. Not sure if the Asian caterers are up to scratch. IFE was kind of limited with very few interesting titles."

The cost was well below other major carriers but the service and comfort did not suffer. Cabins were comfortable and modern, staff were courteous and spoke English when asked. Legroom was very good on the A380 and decent on the A330. Pillows, blankets, and headphones were provided free, which is better than many US carriers. Meals were good with at least two hot meals per flight and a choice of Asian or Western entrees. Beer and wine were available for free in Economy Class alongside the usual beverages. The seatback entertainment selection was large and varied. Although our layover in China was shorter, the airline offers free hotels for waits of more than 8hrs. Ground staff is on hand at the Chinese hubs to assist with transfers between flights. Our checked luggage transferred flawlessly between all legs including domestic US connections. The only minor annoyance was that Delta told us their boarding passes would work for China Southern, but we had to get new ones printed at the gate. I would fly with China Southern again."
no,4,3,3,2,1,1,2,United Airlines,Business,First Class,2022,6,737-900,,,Honolulu,SFO,,,"Terrible plane for that long a flight, Too small - Too noisy! Boeing 737-900 Like most U.S. carriers = the flight attendants are average at best! They spend most of their time socializing with each other and not providing service to passengers. Flying today is just a glorified bus! Passengers are partially to blame, but the airlines are mainly to blame - Baggage fees, paying for meals and drinks, paying for more leg room ""economy plus"". Planes are dirty! Also, United has changed its Frequent Flyer Program and is no longer #1 in my opinion! Loyalty is no longer rewarded. It is all how much you spend for a flight!"
yes,9,5,5,5,4,5,5,China Southern Airlines,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,2022,9,787-9,,,Guangzhou,Beijing,,True," Guangzhou to Beijing on a new Boeing 787-9. This is my first flight on board this type of aircraft. The B787-9 is equipped with Wifi connectivity, free of charge on first come first serve basis. The IFE has high definition screen. Besides that, 3D route path is also available via the IFE. The choice of entertainment are limited as compare to some of the major airlines I had flown. The cabin crew are friendly and helpful. They came to distribute blanket and tower prior to take off. Nowadays, tower is no longer served by many airlines. There were two choices of in flight meal available on board this 2.5 hour flight. The number of choices of beverages served are more than sufficient considered that it is by no means a domestic flight. The overall inflight experience is a comfortable one."
no,3,1,1,1,1,1,3,Emirates,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,2022,3,A380-800 , 777-300ER,,LHR,DAC,DXB,True," London Heathrow to Dhaka via Dubai, returning to Newcastle via Dubai. London Heathrow to Dubai started off well as I only had hand luggage so getting to gate was a breeze thanks to Emirates easy and intuitive mobile check-in. It all went downhill from here though. On boarding was clear my ICE seat back screen was not working or responding. Worse it wouldn't switch off and kept flickering. I informed a member of the cabin crew about the issue but there wasn't a lot of enthusiasm or effort made to help. I asked if could be switched off if it could not be made to work, and never heard anything for the rest of the flight leaving me with flickering screen to contend with for 8 hours which was distracting and didn't really help me sleep on a night flight. I understand things go wrong and am reasonable but its how you handle things that matters. Once over Dubai, landing was delayed and we were put in holding pattern for 1.5 hours due to fog. We were informed that ground staff would be on hand to help those with missed connections and those that had tight ones to make and I was relieved at first to see a lot of staff about. However it seemed they were only helping certain people and when I asked, I got yelled at very disrespecftfully to go look at the departure board. I was left to fend for myself when I only had 20 minutes to get my gate for the flight to Dhaka which was showing as ""Final Call"". Infuriated and out of breath I arrived at the gate just in time to be met with a surly and unapologetic gate staff. I was then shoved on bus in the Dubai heat and we were left there for half an hour without any updates past take-off time. We were then bussed to the cargo terminal where our plane was parked and boarded and then left for a further 45 minutes without much information. The saving grace of the DXB-DAC sector was the crew were quite friendly and warm, and unusually the catering was rather nice. Returning DAC-DXB, even getting into the aiport was a nightmare due the corruption and difficulties that have returned with using Dhaka airport and the use of the local airlines Biman handling team is slow and innefficient. The hassling for money of my elderly mother from her requested assistance was also unwelcome. The flight itself DAC-DXB was uneventful, but the food was atrocious even by Emirates standards - almost inedible. Thas was repeated on the DXB-NCL sector as well. All in all very much going downhill, even the hard product is showing some weariness and there's complacency in improvements on these - the 10 abreast seating on Boeing 777's is horrific. Staff attitude has always been their weak point but it has got particularly bad to the point of contempt, especially when things go wrong. All in all there doesn't seem to be any benefit of flyng Emirates anymore - other carriers do this better now."
no,2,1,3,2,1,4,3,Aer Lingus,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,2022,1,A330,,,BOS,DUB,,True," Boston to Dublin. I hoping to find an alternative to my regular route through London with British Airways. I was really disappointed with Aer Lingus because the plane was incredibly uncomfortable. It was the first flight in years where actually sitting in the seats was deeply uncomfortable. And I do mean seats. I had to move twice as my first seat had a broken headphone connection, the second seat was in a weird location with fixed sides so I couldn't move my hips at all and twisted my back. I was surprised by how many people had major issues with their entertainment screen and I was surprised by how poor it was. The touchscreen was more like ""hit it 4 or 5 times"" screen and watch it go to the wrong thing. I had to use the remote to navigate and it still did not register after 3 times of hitting the button. I gave up after one show because the headphones (a double prong jack so I couldn't use my own headphones) sounded like people talking into a tin can. Everything felt so outdated. I spent a good time out of my seat toward the end of the flight trying to help my back recover. Another bizarre thing was how often they interrupted the entertainment system (or in many people's case sleep) to give inane commentary or play an advert (!) for something Irish or a charity partner. That's find at the end of the flight but in the middle of the night over and over again? It's such a shame as the connection through Dublin was lovely and the short hop to Berlin was just fine, but I just won't be putting my body through that again for long haul."
no,1,2,1,1,2,1,1,Etihad Airways,Family Leisure,Economy Class,2022,6,A320,,,Male,Abu Dhabi,,,"I have flown twice with Etihad in the last week. It was a complete disaster on both flights. Cabin Crew were unprofessional. English announcements were hardly understandable and they kept making announcements once every half an hour during the whole flights - which were both night flights! Neither sleeping nor watching movies was possible this way. Cabin temperature regulation was a mess - passengers in the first 15 rows could not take off enough clothes to deal with the heat while the others in the back were fighting for blankets, of which there were not enough for everybody. Fish for dinner was not cooked properly. Beer and white wine served at the same temperature as the coffee - ridiculous!"

On the way from Amsterdam to Shanghai I did ask for some drink during a flight off 11 hours, but the drinks were finished after 7 hours already! On the way back from Shanghai to Amsterdam also the same - no drinks. And each time I asked, I get the same answer that it is finished. Only water was supplied. Really bad and I will never fly this airline again."
no,5,2,2,3,2,3,3,British Airways,Solo Leisure,Business Class,2022,9,747-400 , 777,,BAH,BOS,LHR,True," Bahrain to Boston via London. First time flying BA after flying Qatar, Emirates and Oman Air business class. Check in at BAH was quick and efficient with their seperate business and first class check in area. BA uses the Dilmun lounge, which is basic but adequate. The flight from BAH to LHR was on a 777. The seats are in a 2x4x2 configuration and are very narrow (similar to premium economy seats, and marginally larger than the economy seats) though reasonably comfortable. When fully flat there is not much room, and people over 6 feet will struggle. There was hardly any storage space, and the IFE screen was very small and of poor quality. The food was very average (I had the carrot and pumpkin soup). Cabin crew was disengaged and the plane felt old and tired. The lounge in Heathrow is large, but gets too busy to be able to sit comfortably. The bathrooms in both the main BA lounges are quite dated and need a good clean far more often then they get. The quality of food in the lounge is average, though the wine and spirit selection is decent. The flight from LHR to BOS was on a 747 and this was similar to the 777 - old and tired with cramped seating for business class. Cabin crew were a bit better on this leg, though still disengaged. The food was of average quality, though the wine list, while small, was good. Overall, BA has the feel of a budget carrier compared to some of its middle eastern counterparts. The lounge is sub par, particularly when compared to the Qatar lounge in Doha, or even the Qantas / One World lounge in LAX. The business class ticket was reasonably cheap, though I can now see why. Given the choice I would not fly BA again."

Cheaper price for tickets, I didnâ€™t receive my luggage when I reached Bombay. I had all my wedding stuff in my bag and wedding was after 2 days. My luggage arrived after 3 days. Waste of money and time. Lady was very rude at LAX counter, when I Checked in my luggage. They didnâ€™t provide me special veg meal. They said you donâ€™t have ordered. I showed them my tickets, after one hour they give me food. Cheaper tickets but not worth it!"
yes,8,4,4,3,5,5,4,Cathay Pacific Airways,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,2022,3,A330-300,,,Taipei,Hong Kong,,True," Taipei to Hong Kong. At the time of booking was originally operated by the A350-900. I was shocked of the last minute change, it was replaced by A330-300 instead. Boarding was in a systematic row by row order, priority given to passengers with special needs. Simple hot meal is available on this short sector flight. The quality of the meal is below average. Nonetheless, I am very impressed with the responsiveness of the cabin crew, the service was quick, thus allow us time to have sufficient to rest. Overall flight journey is average. I hope the management look into the new way to improve the in flight catering."
yes,5,3,2,4,4,3,2,Etihad Airways,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,2022,9,A380,,,Abu Dhabi,New York,,True," Abu Dhabi to New York. Aside from being long, this flight was quite unconventional. I was sitting in seat number 48 K (the first economy cabin where the stairs are). The flight attendant treated the passengers as if they were an inconvenience. She even went out of her way and roughly â€œknockedâ€ the toilet door at me and asked me to â€œhurry up, pleaseâ€ because an old lady was waiting her turn and was apparently in her way. Etihad needs to get crash courses from ANA, Japan Airlines or Qatar Airways on how to treat passengers. Also, who serves spicy chickpeas and lentils on a 14 hour flight!"
no,1,1,3,1,1,2,1,American Airlines,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,2022,9,767,,,ORD,MAN,,,"Chicago to Manchester with American Airlines. Worst flight ever. Route was and is advertised with personal entertainment system choice of movies etc. Plane advertised as 787. Instead what we got was a 30 year old 767 that still had its original interior. 6 screens on the centre ceiling that you needed binoculars to see. The seats were very uncomfortable as they were the same age as the aircraft. I asked the staff if the plane was a joke, he said it was a last resort plane as they had technical issues with the Dreamliner, which I since found out was untrue. According to AA customer service the flight was changed several weeks earlier and is still being used to date as they said in their words ""we used this aircraft because it was more profitable"". The fact that it is advertised with all the mod cons did not concern them at all. The magazine in the seat pocket was all stuck together and some of them were totally in Spanish. The movie was a Disney movie and the people who made the outbound journey on this flight said the movie was in Spanish and could not be changed. The flight was unable to carry any duty free items as they didn't have anywhere to store it. AA customer service offered us a voucher for $100 off our next flight but like I told them ""Why would we ever fly with them again on a 30 year old aircraft when there are far superior carriers out there that actually give you what you pay for?"" Will never fly this airline again, which is a shame as it was the first time with AA and we were so looking forward to it."

However the interior was an earlier one, everything was in perfect condition and worked perfect. ICE is still the best inflight entertainment system, Cabin crew was kind, helpful friendly and attentive on the level that needed. The cabin with the seat is comfortable and giving a great privacy to the travellers. You can easily work, read or relax without being interrupted. A real 1st class service."
yes,8,5,5,1,4,5,4,China Southern Airlines,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,2022,3,A330,,,Brisbane,Delhi,Guangzhou,True," Brisbane to Delhi return via Guangzhou in Economy class. Punctual service. Ground staff efficient and helpful. Very comfortable and clean airplane. Cabin crew were courteous, pleasant and looked after us. Only downside the food was definitely not great, particularly on the return flights from Delhi to Guangzhou and Guangzhou to Brisbane."
yes,5,4,4,1,3,1,2,Turkish Airlines,Business,Economy Class,2022,4,A321,,,IST,CAI,,True," Flew Turkish Airlines from Istanbul Ataturk to Cairo on a midnight flight. Check in was easy and quick, departure lounge was chaotic. A member of Turkish Airlines ground staff was very rude to passengers who had questions about their flight and shouted at one passenger who then refused to fly. Other passengers were telling the ground staff member to calm down and behave appropriately. Passengers were very uncomfortable about the situation. Although the ground staff work for TGS, this incident reflects part of the overall Turkish Airlines product unfortunately. Most passengers had up to three pieces of carry on baggage which delayed the departure of the flight as carry on luggage would not all fit in the over head bins on the aircraft. Turkish Airlines would become more efficient if it enforced a strict carry on baggage policy like other leading airlines do. Onboard experience was OK. Food on the flight was quickly served. It was a cardboard box containing a sandwich, salad and a mousse which was not as good as Egyptair hot food offering on the same route and not what one expects for the amount of money paid for the flight."
yes,9,5,4,3,4,3,4,Turkish Airlines,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,2022,8,A321-200 , 737-800,,Prague,Antalya,Istanbul,True," For my vacation to Turkey I decided to fly with Turkish Airlines instead of a charter airline like SmartWings. We boarded an A321-200 in Prague, seats were really nice with really good pitch and each seat has personal IFE which is geat for a 2 hours flight. The headphones were not very good, but thats ok. Problem was that for half of the flight the IFE wasn't working, but when it did it had plenty of movies, games, music etc. We received a warm sandwich and dessert on this flight which were tasty along with a good seletion of drinks, only problem was that only 1 drinks round was made. Second flight was on a Boeing 737-800 which was a bit older and only had screens above our heads, but it was a 55 minute flight (on the way back this flight was operated by A321-200 with IFE) and even on this short flight we received drinks and food (same sandwich just no dessert). Overall these were really nice flights and I would fly with Turkish again. The A321 was really nice and IFE for 2 hours flight is great, it is just the crew that could be little bit better."
yes,10,4,5,5,4,4,5,Austrian Airlines,Solo Leisure,Business Class,2022,12,767-300,,,Toronto,Vienna,,,"Austrian is my favourite airline to cross the Atlantic. I like Vienna airport for it is small, efficient and convenient. Austrian Airlines is exactly the same. On this 8+ hour night flight from Toronto to Vienna I had a very memorable experience. Because of the change of equipment from what I expected, I ended up sitting in row 7 which has no window. I wasnâ€™t happy! But since it was a night flight and I was going to sleep for most of it I thought I wonâ€™t make a fuss. During dinner service, when the flight attendant asked me if everything was OK, I said yes, adding that it would be great if she could do something about the missing window - jokingly. Well, when I woke up in the morning I look up, and on the wall where the window was supposed to be I had a painting of a window with a beautiful sunrise drawn on it in vibrant colours. Along with a very sweet note from the flight attendant that was serving me. Made my flight! That is attention to detail. Although Austrian doesnâ€™t have the newest planes (Boeing 767-300) and the latest latest business class product, itâ€™s very solid, with great service and some of the best inflight catering Iâ€™ve ever had. I actually look forward to all my meals that are prepared by the onboard chef. To end, there is the substantial Austrian coffee menu, which I adore. I love flying with Austrian!"

yes,6,3,4,4,4,2,3,Air France,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,2022,8,777-300,,,Miami,Beijing,Paris,True," Flew from Miami to Beijing via Paris. My original connection time in Paris was 3hr 15mins, so it was a shocker to me when I, through my own research, found that my flight from Miami to Paris had been delayed for 4 hours and that I would miss my connection. While I understand not all delays are the fault of the airline, it was disappointing that Air France did not contact me-a Sky Priority Customer-informing me of this, and that I had to call the SkyTeam hotline and wait for an hour to get my reroute (through Atlanta). Having said that, the inflight product was above average, and my only complaint would be the price of the Wifi. Overall a solid airline, definitely explore other options first but AF works and provides a solid flight experience."
yes,7,3,5,4,4,3,4,Air India,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,2022,8,787-8,,,Frankfurt,Delhi,,False," Frankfurt to Delhi. First time with Air India for me. I was pretty worried because of the mixed reviews for the airline but because of the cheap price we decided to book them anyway. The check-in and boarding was not the fastest but in the end the flight was on time. Inflight entertainment had nice current hollywood and bollywood options. The service and especially the food was very good. I had mutton with rice and my girlfriend took the vegetarian option. Both meals very very good. The Aircraft had some slight signs of usage but was clean. Overall we would take Air India again because we feeled save, had good food and the overall price-performance ratio was good."
yes,9,5,5,5,4,4,4,Garuda Indonesia,Family Leisure,Business Class,2022,8,A330-200,,,DPS,CGK,,True," Denpasar to Jakarta I was originally booked in economy class but at the gate was upgraded to a Business class seat. The flight was empty though so I don't know why I was upgraded but I am not complaining. Upon boarding, I was provided a hot towel. Shortly after take off, I was served beef Steak with vegetables and mashed potatoes, gado-gado and a caramel cake. The food was delicious. The seat was soft and comfortable. The IFE was Ok but it didn't really matter as it was only an hour and half to Jakarta. Overall, it was an almost perfect flight except for the fact that the large A330 was parked on a remote stand. Good Job Garuda!"
yes,9,5,5,5,5,4,5,ANA All Nippon Airways,Business,Business Class,2022,4,787-9,,,Hong Kong,Tokyo Haneda,,True," Hong Kong to Tokyo Haneda. They fly their latest version of 787 for this service (NH860). Business class seats have a table next to a seat, and you can put your laptop, files, etc while you eat. Seats recline into full-flat, and I do not complain about my leg room. I like this structure of seats. The food was served in a course, and wine selection was good. Cabin attendants are always paying attention to their customers. One pity was business class lounge for Singapore Airline was too crowded, and it was hard to find a seat."

Efficient check in at Heathrow, though Cathay lounge still under renovation which meant use of American Lounge. This whilst spacious was somewhat stark and lacked many of the refinements of CX's own lounges. It served its purpose, however. Both flights with CX were very good and the crew, especially on the second flight excellent, especially as due to a delay leaving HK we had a very tight domestic connection in Auckland. Assistance was arranged to get us quickly through the airport and we made the domestic flight with minutes to spare (a near record - 45 mins from touch down to take off, including a 10 minute walk between terminals. CX's food is generally good and it was a nice touch to be offered chopsticks to go with Asian food. Water bottles were replenished throughout the flights too. The A340 business class is dated, but from 31st October the A350 will be on the Auckland - Hong Kong route which by all accounts will offer an improvement on the already good business class seat of the Boeing 777."

That said, lets say that a great price is a great price for a reason - and usually not a good reason. Before even getting on the plane my customer service nightmare had begun. Our original flight was IAD to LHR (10hr Layover) and then to CAI and SSH. Well about two weeks before we leave, Egyptair cancels our layover in LHR, thus getting us into SSH a day early. That sounds great, but now I have to pay for an extra night of hotel. When I told Egyptair the issue caused by the change, they refused to let us cancel, reimburse any of the extra hotel night. In the end, I just sucked it up and paid. As for the flight itself, the leg from LHR-CAI was a pleasant surprise. We were on a well maintained A330 with decent entertainment and food. No complaints there. On our flight from CAI-SSH, the plane was an old B737. Bottomline - the flights were ok, but the customer and ground service was so bad that I cannot recommend this airline."

Seats and entertainment was fine with no issues. Service and food horrendous. Cabin crew were rude and only thing they where interested in was how quickly they could dish the meals out. Have put a complaint in with Emirates due to a member of staff 'pushing' my fiancÃ© out the way when letting another passanger sit down. On the way home even though sitting next to the cabin crew station, they wouldn't answer the cabin crew service button so I could buy duty free. Also having to listen to the lead cabin crew staff member tell off her staff was a joke. Avoid if you can."
no,2,3,3,1,1,1,2,Garuda Indonesia,Business,Business Class,2022,7,A330-300,,,Jakarta,Haneda Tokyo,,True," The boarding was chaotic, as apparently due to cost saving, GA used one gate for 3 flights departing around the same time, unbelievably a brainless decision! I think it was not only confusing but dangerous (if one goes to the wrong direction, can one end up in another country as all three are international flights). A lot of ground staff around the gate but very inefficient, they did not seem know what to do, so yelled at each other in loud voices. Then we still had to walk a long way through a stuffy corridor to get to the aircraft (parked in domestic area). It was such an irony as I saw Narita-bound LCC Air Asia used the gate next door alone so that passengers did not have to walk far and no chaos. Boarded, was shocked by the new Diamond seat that looked and felt cheap (same design as in their B777 Business but of low-cost material), the design was poor, there was a huge gap between the aircraft window to the seat that anything could easily fall through, and one would have to bother the passenger behind to retrieve. Amenity was worse, of very cheap quality. The food and entertainment menu has not changed in forever, a frequent traveller easily gets bored! Overall did not feel like a genuine 5-star experience, but a fake one!"

From the plane with wide spacious leg room, the most tasteful meal, and the best service of Cabin Crew. It's a long flight but the crew still manage to smile and rendered a good service. From check in counter in San Jose, you can see how courteous and respectful staff they have and to the counter staff in Transfer Desk of Narita so polite and respective manner when you inquire or ask help. ANA is the best!"

This time, flight 712, EWR to CLE. The departure time scheduled 6:14PM, there were at least 4 changed to the departure time with the flight finally leaving EWR at 10:12 pm. The airport staff were indifferent, no offer of anything, not that I expected much after the last United flight (out of EWR) that we were on. They held us on the plane at the gate for over 2.5 hours before starting to let people off, then telling us ""wait, stay on the plane we were ready to depart"", then spending another hour at the gate before finally pushing back. United, you wont get a third chance."

The flight started with all four attendants disappearing from the cabin 20 minutes after takeoff for their unison, leaving passengers to study the menus meanwhile with the aircon set to cold. After reappearing, we were informed by the attendants that only noodle soup and muffins were our food options for the three hour late evening flight. The aircon was then changed to hot."

The trip started with a visit to the Lounge for some much needed breakfast. Both flights were on perfect schedule with boarding really efficient and prioritising premium passengers during the process. The inflight service was average, nothing great about the catering either. IFE was good, just lack options and as for the Cabin Crew, no one really stood out. Qantas really needs to step up its game to keep up with the world's leading airlines."
yes,9,5,5,5,5,3,4,LATAM Airlines,Solo Leisure,Business Class,2022,11,787,,,SYD,SCL,AKL,True," Sydney to Santiago via Auckland, first time travelling business class long haul and LATAM made sure it was great. With the exception of the size of the lavatory and the ground crew in Auckland during transit, I could not nitpick anything. I was pleasantly surprised how great the seats were for length. The lavatory lacked space and was just as cramped as any economy toilet and one member of ground staff decided to get on the phone about one thing while I was boarding holding me up. The manager did come over and tell her to hurry up as it's delaying boarding, but it was frustrating having to wait for what sounded a pointless call. But besides those two things. Very good service and would recommend flying LATAM to anyone."
yes,9,5,5,5,5,2,5,Swiss Intl Air Lines,Couple Leisure,Business Class,2022,11,777,,,Singapore,Zurich,,True," Singapore to Zurich. Ground staff was rude and the Lounge was not convincing, but this is not to fault Swiss but SQ. They use a new aircraft for this route, a B777. The seat is very comfortable, for sitting and sleeping position, it has a function to soften the seat, very comfortable. If you have a bulk head seat also the space for the foot is large enough. I had a very good and long sleep thanks to this comfortable seat. I recommend to reserve a seat in the front cabin as it is very quiet there. The service was very good, friendly and attentive. The food was excellent. Good wine choice. Overall a great experience - I wish every flight was as nice as this one!"
yes,9,5,5,3,4,5,4,Cathay Pacific Airways,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,2022,2,777,,,Vancouver,Hong Kong,,True," Always nice to step on to Cathay Pacific, especially after a number of recent flights on American based airlines. Greeted on boarding and welcomed with a glass of champagne. Premium economy seats comfortable and smaller cabin relaxed and quiet even cabin PE was almost full. Efficient and friendly service throughout the flight, appropriate for the departure time from Vancouver. Food was acceptable. Arrived in to Hong Kong on time and in good shape."
yes,6,3,3,4,3,2,3,American Airlines,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,2022,9,777,,,LHR,JFK,,,"American Airlines is hit and miss on most flights. Sometimes great service, sometimes not so great. They should have longer turnaround times in London Heathrow, because I often take their flights from there to LAX/JFK and the planes are dirty. This time, I opened up my screen at row 16 and there was food, drinks and everything else on the screen. The table dirt was the same. Seats had food bits in them. This flight was okay, food was better. Planes are packed these days, so even as Exec Plat, I had no chance of the system wide upgrade."
yes,9,5,4,5,5,4,4,Singapore Airlines,Business,Economy Class,2022,2,777-300ER,,,Singapore,Sydney,,True," Singapore Airlines has impressed me on the Singapore-Sydney route for the first time. It is evident that the morning flights are much better than the night time flights. As SQ 211 departed, a great lunch was served followed by multiple drink rounds before a mini pizza prior to landing, which compares well against the red eye SQ221 and 231. The staff were quite courteous with the exception of one cabin crew member, the rest were extremely pleasant. Specially the leading crew in charge was particularly friendly. Flight landed ahead of schedule and all in all, I couldn't fault the service."
no,1,3,1,2,1,1,1,Emirates,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,2022,3,A380,,,Zurich,Kolkata,Dubai,True," On my 8.35 am flight, March 3 from Dubai to Zurich the sound was not working. What a horrible experience. Not only mine 44C, but also 44 A and B. Flight attendant said he would bring another ear piece, one hour later he said he forgot. Told him it's the jack that was not working, not the ear piece. One hour later, he brought another ear piece, then one more. Smarter supervisor listened and said that it unfortunately was the jack that was not working. Offered to find another place to sit, but they forgot. 7 hour, boring long flight."
yes,10,5,5,5,5,5,5,Qatar Airways,Solo Leisure,Business Class,2022,4,777,,,Doha,Munich,,True," Doha to Munich. Crew: Awesome, dedicated, beautiful, pleasant, and attentive. The crew and the supervisor onboard of the flight were top notch. The best that I have interacted with compared to other airlines. The crew kept checking in with me to see if I am comfortable. Aircraft: The Qsuite was clean, comfortable and private. The in-flight entertainment system was responsive and showed no signs of lag. F&B: Spoilt for choices. The signature drink was a blast. Fine dining experience. Overall, the food was awesome. Overall, this airline has won my heart. I was smitten by the level of service and I will keep on flying with QR."
no,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,Sunwing Airlines,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,2022,4,?,,,Toronto,Varadero,,True," Toronto to Varadero. When in line to check in you should not question 14 of us that this is the Elite line, we paid for this service, which I might add gives you nothing. When checking in your staff could try and be a little bit more pleasant, smile, talk! When on the flight your staff could be a little bit more happier, and perhaps let the people whom really need to use the washroom use it. Please tell me what, if anything, is going on behind that little curtain that will not allow people to use the washroom? Your service is downright awful."
yes,10,5,5,5,4,5,5,Emirates,Solo Leisure,First Class,2022,8,A380,,,CPT,LHR,DXB,True," The service I have received flying Emirates has been of a consistently high standard, but on my flight from Cape Town to Dubai the cabin staff were excellent, extremely helpful and friendly. It was such a pleasant flight although I wish the cabin temperature had been coler. Food and drink is on demand, and of a good quality. The transfer arrangements at Dubai airport were well organised and everything ran smoothly. I will be using this airline as much as I can in the future."
no,7,3,4,2,4,4,4,Singapore Airlines,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,2022,3,A380,,,London Heathrow,Sydney,Singapore,True," London Heathrow to Sydney via Singapore. Both myself and my wife enjoyed the overall experience, responsive flight attendants and very friendly. Our only real complaint is the food which we found to be rather unappetising and repetitive, perhaps a few European or English dishes would be a refreshing change and certainly more welcoming to our palate."
yes,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,Jetblue Airways,Family Leisure,Economy Class,2022,6,E190,,,RDU,FLL,,,"It was the first time my children had flown, so I wanted it to be good. From the beginning, JetBlue kept me happy. I had TSA precheck when we arrived, and I didn't ask for it. When we boarded the plane, we boarded first because we had a small child. There was no extra charge for this. Our flight took off 20 min early so we arrived early. During the flight, we were quickly offered snacks and a drink. The attendant came around selling ear buds for $5 to use with the TV at each seat. Having your own TV made the flight enjoyable. At the end of the flight, deplaning was just as pleasant. The price was also better than anyone else, and there were no problems with my luggage. One more thing-my very picky husband who is 6'3"" had plenty of legroom. We did not upgrade to even more space, but he still had plenty of legroom and was very comfortable in a normal seat!"
yes,10,5,5,5,5,5,5,China Southern Airlines,Solo Leisure,Business Class,2022,8,A330-200,,,CAN,AMS,,True," I'm quite satisfied with China Southern Airlines cabin service for my trip in business class from Guangzhou to Amsterdam. The VIP lounge in Guangzhou airport was of perfect setting, various drinks and food provided. The attendants showed patience to us during boarding. Because the traditional Chinese Mid-Autumn festival is on the way, they offered us Chinese tea and delicious mooncakes as desserts. Since I am a big fan of Chinese culture, I took some pictures under their permission. Enough leg rest room in the seat helped me to get a good sleep in 13 hours. A personal toiletry kit was provided in every business passenger seat. I appreciate this airline and I would choose it again."
yes,9,4,5,4,3,4,4,Air Canada rouge,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,2022,9,767-300,,,YYZ,EDI,,True," I have just completed my 10th flight with Air Canada rouge in their premium rouge class. I have never tried rouge or rouge plus offerings therefore I cannot comment on them. I have used premium rouge every year over the Toronto - Edinburgh route since they started in 2013. All flights have been on their B767-300. Rouge is ACs Leisure airline with lower operating costs than mainline AC, it is not advertised as a low cost carrier. It is however clearly advertised on the AC web site as a different product to mainline AC. My tip would be to do some research before you travel. On this trip I checked in at Bermuda as I was on a through ticket BDA/YYZ/EDI. Boarding at YYZ followed the standard AC arrangements with premium rouge passengers boarding in group 2. I was given a warm welcome on board having been recognized by a crew member from a previous rouge flight. The seat has similar pitch and width to those used on AC mainline business class service in N. America. (Including Bermuda & Caribbean) Each premium passenger had a small overnight amenity kit and bottled water on the seat waiting for them. Tablets for the rouge IFE system were handed out by FAs prior to departure. The use of these is included in the premium package. Departure from YYZ was a couple of minutes early and once in the air dinner menus were handed out. There was a choice of two main dishes. The drinks and meal service appeared much more professional in its presentation and co-ordination than it was in the â€˜earlyâ€™ days of rouge. The table ware is exactly the same as in ACs N. American business having experienced this on the earlier BDA/YYZ sector. The only issue on the flight was an un-serviceable washroom at the front of the plane. We were directed to use the facility mid-cabin. One of these, clearly for use by disabled passengers, was the biggest aircraft washroom I have every used. I managed about 2 hours light sleep or doze before a light breakfast of banana cake, juice tea/coffee was served. Arrival at EDI was a few minutes early. I continue to recommend AC premium rouge for a short (ish) trans Atlantic flight, in fact I have another premium rouge flight booked for March over DUB/YYZ, unfortunately the EDI service is summer seasonal only which for me is a bit of an niggle."
yes,8,4,4,3,4,4,4,Qatar Airways,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,2022,10,A380 , A350,,LHR,SIN,DOH,,"London to Singapore via Doha. Very impressed with the economy service and product offering on Qatar Airways on their brand new A380 and A350 aircraft. Aircraft spotlessly clean on both legs. Seating the same on both aircraft, very comfortable with good legroom and reasonable seat width. Felt more cramped on the A350. Crew professional and friendly on both legs. Good meal services on both flights, although I note on daylight flights in this case London to Doha the meal service and offering is much more extensive than on the early morning flights 0230am from Doha to Singapore. Inflight entertainment good and extensive choice not just of Western movies/tv but content from around the world. The Oryx IFE system they use is not that user friendly and can be clumsy. 15 minutes free wifi offered on both flights, but no point in using as the system times out constantly. Bathrooms kept clean throughout both flights. Only real negatives about experience, very long and drawn out safety announcements done in both Arabic and English but not simultaneously, way too much advertising of Qatar Airways, Qatar banks etc. Inflight entertainment interrupted too many times with charity videos and arrival videos for Doha. The new Doha airport for economy class passengers very bland, very poor food outlet choices, expensive shops, but lack of sitting area, shower and rest facilities for such a major global hub."
yes,9,4,5,3,4,4,4,Singapore Airlines,Business,Economy Class,2022,6,A330-300,,,Adelaide,Singapore,,True," Adelaide to Singapore and the best crew I have had on a flight. Two members addressed passengers (including myself) by name for the whole flight. Attendants were chatty and polite, and spent time providing passengers with hints of what to see and do in Singapore. Very frequent rounds of drinks. Aircraft was clean. IFE was not the latest generation but the screen size was big enough and the selection of movies was more than adequate. The only downside was food, where Singapore Airlines normally does not shine. Portions were big but quality can be better. Ground staff at Adelaide airport very polite and helpful. SilverKris lounge small but well-stocked. Overall, a great experience."
yes,8,4,5,4,3,5,5,China Southern Airlines,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,2022,9,737-800,,,Kota Kinabalu,Guangzhou,,True," Kota Kinabalu to Guangzhou. This is my first international flight with China Southern Airlines. I requested for a seat an emergency exit row upon check in and was granted without any charges. The cabin crew assisted me to my seat upon boarding. Flight departed slightly ahead of schedule. I am truly delighted with the hospitality and assistance rendered by the cabin crew through out the entire journey. The cabin crew are always around to check if the passenger require any beverages after the in flight meal. They even came to inform me the latest temperature on the destination prior to landing. Overall flight experience was smooth and satisfactory. Nonetheless, there are still room for improvement on the in flight entertainment. This aircraft does not equipped with CS entertainment apps whereby passenger can select the choice of entertainment via the mobile phones. The flight / route path was not available either on board,"
yes,6,4,3,3,3,3,3,British Airways,Couple Leisure,First Class,2022,1,A380,,,Johannesburg,London,,True," A380 boarding is always a nightmare, but it was complicated on this occasion by multiple pax in wheelchairs and a delayed show-up by the pilots. Fortunately, we still managed to take off more or less on time. The cabin crew responsible for our side of the First cabin was personable but lacked experience. The food served for dinner was a mixture of good and mediocre. Warm salmon on ice cold salad is never a pleasant experience. The seats in First are reasonably comfortable although they lack the privacy of competitors' premium cabin. The duvet was made redundant because of the typically overheated cabin. One of the First toilets was out of action so we had to make use of the Club World loos upstairs. It would have been helpful if cabin crew had apologised for the inconvenience for the lack of the convenience, but no comment was made. The IFE was passable and the sound quality good if one's own noise cancelling headphones are used. WiFi was available but I didn't make use of it. Breakfast was unremarkable and I wish bread rather than pastries was offered. Deplaning was delayed by half-an-hour because of early morning congestion at T5 and the lack of a stand. Overall, a reasonable flight but not first class."
no,1,3,1,3,3,3,1,Emirates,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,2022,10,A380,,,CDG,DXB,,True," I flew from Paris CDG to Dubai DXB on Saturday 1 October 2016, 15.35 â€“ 00.20 with Emirates, EK 074. The flight was good, but the service is far from expected. I asked for a hot chocolate during the meal time, it took ages and I had to ask another flight attendant. When it arrived it was cold and had been filled with cold milk. I made a complaint to the purser, she apologised and they served another one. During the dessert, they served ice cream, but for myself and my wife there was no spoon. We ended up with the tea stirrer. Furthermore, I saw a flight attendant queuing for the toilets in front of me, and refusing to assist passengers. Usually, they use the toilet at the far end, in the back. I really regret picking Emirates."
yes,10,4,4,4,4,4,3,Lufthansa,Business,Economy Class,2022,10,747-400,,,Frankfurt,"Washington, D.C.",,True," Sitting onboard the spacious and iconic 747-400 is always a pleasure. Lufthansa has a modern entertainment system and the internet (17â‚¬ for 24 hours) is quite okay. On-time departure, actually we are currently ahead of schedule. Food and drinks are above average. Seat space is also above average. Friendly crew, efficient airport. I cannot complain."
yes,9,5,5,5,5,4,4,Emirates,Solo Leisure,Business Class,2022,4,777,,,Malta,Larnaca,,True," Emirates is an excellent way to fly from Malta to Larnaca. Check in opened two hours before departure, together with fast lane security an invitation to the excellent La Valletta Club lounge was given. This lounge even has an outdoor area where you can view the aircrafts landing and starting. A separate bus was provided to the aircraft where I was welcomed by the international crew. Juice was served before take-off, champagne in the air, then the menues were handed out. A three course menu was served with the possibility to choose between various alternatives. An international variety of wines and other beverages were also available. Landing on time after 2 hrs and 10 minutes. Free complimentary transfer to hotel in Larnaca. I great way to fly."
yes,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,Iberia,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,2022,6,A340-600 , A320,,Santiago de Compostela,New York,Madrid,True," Santiago de Compostela to New York via Madrid. Flew from Santiago de Compostela on Iberia Express to Madrid yesterday to connect to our Iberia flight to New York. I can see why Iberia Express gets its 'most punctual airline' reputation. Boarding was swift, very organized and we departed about 5mins ahead of schedule. On board, sadly there wasn't much to say except the legroom was very tight and even a coffee had to be paid for. The crew seemed pleasant and helpful. I was however, not able to connect to the advertised free streaming entertainment at all. Not a huge deal breaker as it was a short flight. I had decided to take up an email offer to upgrade my next sector to New York and was so glad I did. Having priority boarding as a part of it was a huge plus on this maxed out A340-600. I loved the Premium Economy seat with the extra recline and legroom was great. It's a fresh, relatively small, more private cabin than the wild expanse of regular economy. The larger, responsive, IFE screen worked well and had just enough options to keep me occupied for 7 hours. The very slightly upgraded meal (main served in a china dish) was fairly decent thought it took quite a while after take off before it was served. There was no bar service before this. The crew were warm and pleasant though and seemed to be constantly working. We sat in row 15 which is only slightly ahead of the galley, so could hear everything and the light from the galley was distracting at times. The pre-arrival snack of a boxed sandwich was fine and we arrived only slightly late into JFK. All in all, I'd recommend Iberia's Premium Economy if you do get an email offer to upgrade. Very comfortable seat, more personalized service and priority boarding made the decision easy for me."
no,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,United Airlines,Business,First Class,2022,9,777-200,,,SFO,SYD,,,"San Francisco to Sydney with United Airlines, and stunningly horrendous service in GlobalFirst. I have traveled in economy on foreign airlines that provide better service than what this flight delivered. The seat was dirty and worn. No sleep topper was provided, nor pajamas like other airline First class provides. The pre-departure drink was served in a plastic cup! The menu had 3 entree selections for a 14 hour flight - all disgusting with heavy cream sauces to mask the inedible food. Not even a wine list was provided, in first class on a $12,000 ticket! The extremely senior cabin crew were out of shape and very uninterested in providing service, with one banging into my seat throughout the flight. Lavatory was absolutely disgusting - never once did a flight attendant attempt to keep it tidy. Breakfast was a joke - two choices and lucky to get a banana with my cereal! Juice was canned concentrate. Not even cappuccino or espresso. How does United Airlines pass this embarrassment off and justify the ticket price on such a high profile route?"
no,2,1,2,1,1,3,1,United Airlines,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,2022,9,757,,,LHR,EWR,,,"A friend of mine arranged 2 seats for my daughter and I to travel United Airlines on a Boeing 757 from Heathrow to Newark in Economy class. Subsequently I was able to upgrade us both (for a fee) into Premium Economy. Sadly when booking this, no one mentioned that the two exit seats booked over the wing had so called ""limited recline"" - in fact no recline whatsoever. This was a very uncomfortable flight caused me to have back ache the following week. It would have been nice to have a choice of a seat that actually reclined a little for the long flight to Newark. We have been told there is no chance of any refund on the excess paid to ""upgrade"". I guess we will remember that when next we choose an airline to fly across the atlantic."
yes,10,5,5,5,5,5,5,SAS Scandinavian,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,2022,2,A330,,,Stockholm,Hong Kong,,True, I flew from Stockholm ARN to Hong Kong HKG with SAS Airbus 330. Long haul flight in SAS Plus. The flight was comfortable in the new SAS cabin. The cabin crew was excellent and the onboard wifi and entertainment system worked very well. The aircraft was clean according to the highest standards. I definitively recommend SAS for long haul flights.
no,4,3,4,1,1,1,1,Aeromexico,Business,Business Class,2022,12,787,,,New York,MÃ©xico.,,,"Nice airplane with the worst catering you can get with a US $3,400 ticket plane, among two type of average wines without any chance to finish your meal with a nice Gin Tonic or good blend whiskey or a nice old age cognac which is standard in many other airlines. Plus, the entertainment offer is outdated, they don't rotate the movies as often as should be. You can find the same films offered in the same route from one year ago! Among a suspicious tendency for silly comedies with bad taste and low quality. When you finally arrive, the crew opens all the acces of the aircraft to exit the plane without giving to the upper paying class tickets passengers the privilege to get out in the first place, policy that makes the exit from every plane from these Aeomexico airplanes, a nightmare. The Aeromexico system at the check in (there are just two guys attending the suitcases) counters are very inefficient in contrast with the air crews that always are prone to help you an any way they can. Plain and simple: terrible Business class experience."

Although KLM Business class cabin was refurbished, the 13-year old aircrafts looked old and tired. Reasonable lie-flat seating but not up to other airlines' standard. Very nice, friendly crew, the captain took time to chat with the passengers. Mediocre catering and wine offer, including an awful Brazilian red. Snacks on return very poor. As they are launching their flight to BOG and CLO, KLM are offering both Dutch and Colombian typical fare almost unedible. Nice amenity kits, good IFE and duty free sales. Smooth connections at AMS, despite our luggage being delayed for one day in the outbound leg, due to our short connection. Will fly KLM again if they provide reasonable Business class fares as it happened this time."
yes,5,3,5,2,2,3,3,Finnair,Business,Premium Economy,2022,7,A330-300 , A321,,New York JFK,Chania,Helsinki,True," New York JFK to Chania via Helsinki. First time on Finnair. Clean, spacious cabin in light blue, grey colors. Flight attendants looked smart in black outfits with trimmings. Had an economy class ticket but was seated in premium economy. Plane was uncrowded and all immediate seats around me were empty. On time departure and arrival at Helsinki was early. Very limited movie selection on personal IFE. Food was very basic. Meat balls for dinner and a cold jaw breaking sandwich for breakfast. Flight attendants courteous. Some distinctive Finnish items on the duty free offerings. An amenity kit was provided. Flight from Helsinki to Chania was packed with holiday goers. Complimentary soft drinks only. A drop down TV screen showed the flight route. Again, on time arrival. All in all, an efficient, unremarkable flight."
no,1,2,4,1,1,1,1,British Airways,Business,Business Class,2017,1,747-400,,,London Heathrow,Miami,,True," London Heathrow to Miami. I was looking forward to this flight - it was Saturday so no work the following day and 62K on the upper deck used to be such a treat! I have read many reviews recently of BA falling behind the competition so my expectations were low - but even these were beaten by this overall truly awful experience. Firstly I have to say the crew on the flight were super in every way. Nothing was too much trouble and they seemed to genuinely be enjoying their work. I should have given my 'BA Golden Ticket' to one of them but forgot. However no matter how good the crew, it cannot make up for everything else being totally awful and shabby. The seat was filthy with what looked like ketchup from the previous flight and crumbs everywhere. Not a nice start. The aircraft was very very old - a lot of the interior was patched up with white gum. The IFE didn't work properly. Amenity kit was a bag and the headsets poor quality. The toilets (compared to AA) were small unpleasant. Seat is not up to most Business class standard. Food was awful and the 'club kitchen' almost non-existent. These days I would choose AA (or Delta, United, Virgin) any day over BA. It was a shame the flight manager seemed to spend his time going round the cabin apologising and giving some avios to try and make people less annoyed by the whole experience."
no,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,Air India,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,2022,1,777,,,BOM,JFK,DEL,,"Mumbai to New York JFK via Delhi on Air India. Broken seating, entertainment consoles that don't work, dirt, lost baggage, unannounced stop-overs, overstuffed overhead baggage compartments, unhelpful staff. This airline used to be top-notch back in the 70's, but is now little more than cattle-truck service. I am embarrassed by this national carrier and will never use Air India again."
no,4,4,2,4,3,3,4,Thai Airways,Family Leisure,Economy Class,2022,12,777-300 , A350-900,,Kuala Lumpur,Osaka,Bangkok,True," Kuala Lumpur to Osaka via Bangkok. The flight from KL to Bangkok was fantastic and crew were so friendly and smiling. Can feel their passion in serving the customer. Though it was a 2-hour flight, they managed to serve everything smoothly until landing. Second sector was from Bangkok to Osaka. Crew were like robot. Not even ask the passengers about their choice of meal and directly give passengers whatever the meal they are holding. Crew were not seen serving drinks during the mid of the flight. No warm towel prior to take off and landing. Inflight entertainment was passable. Seat is comfort. Third sector was from Osaka to Bangkok. Some crew were very rude. Rushing for the meal and expecting the passengers to finish it quickly. Even heard a enior crew raised her voice to at least three passengers, ""Finish? Bring this go there (finger point to the back galley) I won't come back again, understand!"" The flight was six-hour long and why don't give some time for the passengers to enjoy their meals slowly. No beverage serving / crew going round the cabin with drinks in the mid of the flight. Crew takes long time to answer call bell. The same goes to the last sector. Rushing to do their service and very impatient. Few times I observed the crew can't wait to push away the cart perhaps the passengers were still thinking of what the crew were saying or couldn't listen to it clearly. For money wise, yes it's cheaper than some other airlines. In terms of inflight entertainment, it's not as interesting as SQ, EK or CX. Lavatory doesn't provide any toiletries, only a bottle of cologne."

I was very sceptical about flying this airline after reading reviews from different websites, but we had a wonderful experience. We were upgraded to 1st from Business as our PEK-PVG flight was late arriving in PVG because of bad weather. The flight attendants were outstanding and very polite and professional. The food was top shelf and the entertainment was equal to other airlines."

They let me check in early even though there was no gate available for my flight. Boarding was delayed 15 minutes due to landing congestion. Inflight I ordered chicken fried rice, as expected it was very edible and delicious, and it was coupled with friendly Flight Attendants as expected. IFE, working properly although due to the flight time (1.40 hours) I was unable to watch the movie I choose until the end. I can't rate the Wi-Fi because 737s aren't equipped with it."

Outbound I had a broken USB in first seat outbound, then broken headphone jack on second. 2 meter trim strip falling off and into aisle. Climate control failure onboard had passengers sweating profusely. Return flight, suddenly my carryon, which had flow with me all over Canada for 3.5 weeks (I was covering the Women's World Cup) is too large or too heavy, though it is max carry on size on other airlines I've flown. Wouldn't let us board. After 30 minutes and showing them the photographic gear they wanted me to put below (they would not guarantee it's safety,) they finally accepted my idea to put my camera bag in the crew area. Onboard, they ran out of food. Flight attendants left our consumed flood on our trays for 1.5 hours. When I rang call button to ask them to pick up the tray, I was chastised and told to set it on the floor.

Flights are on time, the attendants are friendly and the meals are very good. The entertainment system is excellent and easy to use.

As a Star Alliance Gold Card member, Lufthansa has occasionally upgraded me, so they have my loyalty! I think it is a great airline."

I have recently flown via Turkish Airlines and it was not pleasant experience compare to previous years. I could only say that this North America flight has gone downhill in last few years. The plane seemed aged, seats were not comfy, narrow for 10 hours flight. It could be my luck getting an older plane, and it could be different with newer planes for the same route. Check-in to the flight was a complete mess. Instead of calling with zones or Tier everyone invited to open counters, and it caused huge line ups and mess in the plane. Cabin staff was nice, courteous but not helpful. They lied about foods to people especially who were not a native speaker of Turkish. They passed, drinks and food items over passengers heads to their colleague if they were out on their carts. I felt extremely warm in my seat. Complained about it and the answer was this is the coldest they can get at this altitude for maximum air quality in the cabin. The final part is that 2 of my luggage get lost on this flight, Turkish Airlines cannot locate my luggage, and each representative over the phone tells different location. We are now getting into 72 hours, but no one knows where my luggage is."

Nice amenity kit. Pillow ok (a bit small) and nice comforter. The video screen was large and the IFE selection was excellent. Food was disappointing - bland and overcooked. Wine and champagne selection was good. International airport lounge in Mexico City closed early at 10pm and they had us move to a very crowded domestic lounge farther away from the gates. The second lounge was dirty, wines were not re-stocked and food was sparse. It was a mess. The cabin staff was the rudest I have ever experienced in business class on any airline. Bare minimum. Rarely came through the cabin. I was not served at dinner, asked for a meal and a drink after waiting over an hour and was treated very rudely. It is a pity that this airline, which has obviously invested heavily in nice equipment, has such lousy service staff - both on the ground and in the air. They need to fix it. I would avoid them."
yes,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,Cathay Pacific Airways,Business,Business Class,2022,4,777-300ER,,,MNL,ORD,HKG,True," Manila to Chicago via Hong Kong. Check in and security at MNL was quick, considering the outbound flight was at 0500. After a quick stop to the lounge, it was a bit of a walk to gate 111 where there was quite a crowd boarding but the business lane was pretty quick getting onboard. Regional configuration in the MNL-HKG leg with good and warm service. Food was passable and forgettable, as can be expected by CX catering. After a 3 hour transit, the long HKG-ORD leg for a quick business trip to Chicago. Previously flew the A359 and the business seats on the 773 was a bit of a letdown compared to the fantastic newer product (it's a shame if the rumors are true that CX will change the business seats of the 359). Nonetheless, the reverse herringbone layout allows for great privacy and the seat provides numerous storage options for large and small items. Catering was better than the first leg with very responsive service and very unobtrusive for those who want to sleep. Special mention to the chief purser who made the service a joy. IFE was a bit of a letdown as well, but I suppose it was just that the selection of movies, while extensive, did not contain those that appealed to me. On the return leg, the company messed up the connecting day which was resolved very quickly on the ground in ORD. In-flight service to HKG and MNL was more robotic and less warm. They have a good business product, but for an Asian airline, I think it could up its game a little bit to play with the other big boys in the region (Singapore, ANA, Asiana)."

It was a pleasant flight, upgraded to business class, the airline do not provide lounge access and fast track for upgrades. The flight itself was ok, with flat bed to sleep, sophisticated meal prepared by class chefs - a nice surprise. Large screen with new releases for entertainment. Cabin crew was polite and friendly, helpful during the flight, which was on time."

We have to buy Priority boarding to have cabin baggage with us and still had to wait in a long queue. All people were buying Priority and the cabin was full of luggage! Ryanair have just found out how to make money from it. Also, the seats! Me and my husband were sitting on different sides of the plane, both alone in the rows! This is a joke. If we want to sit together - pay more money again! Moreover, the flight was delayed for an hour and we were stuck inside the plane. I will never fly with Ryanair again!"

First off, they cancelled my original flight home. So, I had to spend an extra night in Lisbon, which was actually a little fun. I got to walk around Lisbon, and I had a great dinner. TAP covered the hotel bill and it was okay. With that said, they promised to cover us for dinner, which never happened, but breakfast was included. They also provided transport. As for the flights, they could have been better. Food was so so, but you could get free beer or wine. Seats were uncomfortable. Also, beware of paying extra for seats. They switched airplanes on my flight to Lisbon, and didn't bother to switch my seat to the emergency row-even thought I paid 65 Euro for it. In the end, I got an emergency row seat, but not the one I wanted and paid for. On the way back to America, I got the proper emergency row seat, but the in-flight entertainment didn't work for me, despite several attempts to reset it. With this all in mind, the flights did fly on time, and my flight back to the US was early, which helped with my connection. All things considered, I would not fly this airline again if I can help it. Too much trouble, and I was one of the lucky ones. I was part of a tour of Morocco where everyone flew TAP, and many people were out hundreds of dollars with the one-day delayed flight. I was lucky because I procrastinated about buying my flights to Newark and back Minnesot. Others bought their flights to Newark early, and they were out of luck."

Food was atrocious : some ""lattice"" chicken wrap that tasted like paper filled with some red stuff but without chicken. Cold tea only drink option. Friendly staff. Way back with no IFE, modern A330, with normal seats, the same revolting food. Excellent crew. Both flights constant pushing by crew to buy duty free. I have lived in HK for one year now and the locals rave about Cathay Pacific. Beyond their obsession with air miles, I scratch my head why. I don't know why this is work's preferred carrier. Any low cost airline can fare equally."

The good thing is that they are fully flat, the bad thing is that they do not all offer direct aisle access (and that there are 3 seats together in the middle row in business class). That said, I also have to say that the Buenos Aires - Istanbul flight is very long because of the stop in Sao Paulo, but flying business class in TK makes it seem shorter, the IFE is quite good and the food is great. I take this flight twice a year and even though the food service deteriorated a bit lately, it is still very good compared to other airlines (unfortunately on my last flights there was no more amuse bouche, no more many options of starters to pick from the trolley and no more final trolley with coffee and petit fours-the latter was now consolidated with the dessert trolley, also the champagne on board was downgraded from Taittinger to Mumm). As I said the meals service is still good but it could be a lot better if flight attendants would be more proactive at offering drinks and refills. They just do not do it, you need to call them every time you need a refill (it does not happen in many other airlines) and when you do they take forever and it is obvious are not willing to do it. Overall, I would recommend TK business class because the food is very good and the seats are confortable, but they need to improve the service on board. If they did, they would be quite perfect."

Food was average but they still provided wide range of drinks and wine. The time arrived Hong Kong on time and the luggage was already well ready when we reach the luggage belt.

It is immoral of Air Canada to use this such an airplane for a long night flight over 8 hours. We were extremely uncomfortable, there was no entertainment and little service.

The lounge Cathay use in DPS was abysmal, felt more like a foot massage salon, very poor.The seats on the A330 are far inferior to those on the the A350, I was lucky enough to change the seats to an exit. Crew on my side of the aisle were courteous, once again acknowledging my Emerald status, however on my friends side the attendant basically barked at her, and at Cathay they have a trend of screaming â€˜mind your kneesâ€™ as they pull the cart up the aisle seemed very unprofessional. The Pier lounge at Hong Kong was outstanding. No Emerald recognition on the LGW sector, crew seemed very new and unsure of their role, I think Cathayâ€™s more â€˜Senior crewâ€™ work in the premium cabins. I really donâ€™t understand after 4 long sectors how this airline has reached 5 star status, it really is let down by poor inflight service. I would only recommend for the price paid for the ticket and the lounges in HKG."

One the first leg to Abu Dhabi we were served by an uncaring lady. She was robotic, no smile, no courtesy, nothing. The choice of meal had ran out on a flight that was not even full. On the second leg of the journey, the meal served was awful. Rice and lamb served was inedible as it was very salty, the salad tasted stale. Traveling with a child I thought Etihad might provide a toy / colouring book to keeping them engaged for sometime, nothing was provided. Booking for a family of 6, I had choices when I booked with Etihad. My past experience was good which swayed my decision, even though at the time of booking the competitors had slightly lower rates. From now on Etihad will be my last choice."

Check-in was fast and easy by Korean's contracted ground handlers in Denpasar. The flight boarded and pushed back on-time. While the flight overall was fairly comfortable (good seat pitch, good seat-back inflight entertainment, pillow & blanket provided), Korean's cabin crew are very cold and without any personality. They are very robotic in everything they do. The cabin crew was very unfriendly and disingenuous while attending to the passengers - forced, half-smiles when serving the meal and drink service (the breakfast served - was soggy and virtually inedible). This is such a shame because they are dressed to impress and fly onboard such nice airplanes. If only they provided warm, caring hospitality, they would truly be an outstanding airline. Until then, I would not fly on them again by choice."

Business priority class. Everything went wrong from the moment we have arrived to the airport to check-in. flydubai supervisor let us check in without a word about any problem. But I could hear something about late taking off to another customer who wanted to go to passport control. I had to go to her and ask her directly, if the information of flight delay is correct. She said: Yes, approximately 4 hours of being delayed. I went to her again and ask her if it is true, because we are having a meeting in Dubai, hotel confirmed and we are going to see the New YearÂ´s fireworks. She answered: It is your problem. You must be comming earlier. When it was 17:30 pm, there was a sign on departure schedule board: Dubai FZ780: departure 23:00. No one came to us, no info what is happening etc. After my asking to airport staff I was answered that there is a thick fog at DXB airport (but plane is from 15:30 at Prague airport). FlyDubai supervisor wasnÂ´t at her office and no one could reach her. No official info from flydubai representative. It was a really poor apology and answer about the fog. Turkish airlines, Emirates with the big airbus, SwissAir, SmartWings and many other flights from PRG to DXB were departing and the flights from DXB were landing in PRG. But only FlyDubai customers were sitting on the floor in a hall and waiting hours for new information. I have checked the weather radar at DXB airport from my notebook and the visibility was from 8km to 10km. After another complaining, I got the phone number to flydubai representative help line. No answer, just automatic speech (Thank you for your calling to flydubai, for communication in english press 1 and my call was automaticly cancelled). Help line didnÂ´t help at all. Finally at 22:00 a new schedule of Dubai departure showed PRG to DXB FZ780 FlyDubai: 1:00 am 1st January 2017. I was so upset and annoyed. I realized that my business, hotel reservation and New YearÂ´s firework are totally buried. I wanted my money back and wanted to cancel the journey. When I reached the flydubai representative, I was told that no cancellation is available due to weather conditions. I asked the captain with his crew who were just passing us and arrived to PRG from Africa with stop on DXB and continuing to PRG and he told us, that it is nice and sunny in DXB without any problems. The representative of flydubai told us after this, that pilots need to have a rest and will not fly. After protests of other passangers, they gave us 10 dollars ticket for refreshment, but in Duty free zone there was everything closed because of the New YearÂ´s Eve. At midnight a member of airport came to business lounge and said: The lounge closes normally at 19:00 and it is 24:00 now. Go to the counters down to the hall to the others. Small kids, infants, old people, no matter. At 1:00am next day departure schedule board shows FlyDubai FZ780 to DXB planned departure 7:00 morning. Flight delayed 18 hrs in total, no hotel (they said none available), no refreshment, no help, no info, no more flydubai."

Due to the inflight upgrade agreement that the food will be equivalent to economy class. But the crew were very generous to give me extra snacks and fruits.

He doesn't like curry so it was whispered to him that he could have a veggie meal. Same at breakfast - served half hour early so had to eat alone. When other breakfasts came out, guess what no meat. On complaining to BA Customer Services, told could choose another meal if we had gone on line and paid extra.

I must say I was pretty underwhelmed. First leg was a overnight flight and sitting in seat 20k in 4 class configuration it was impossible to sleep due to the constant vibration of the engine with the seat being directly above the wing. Return journey was in seat 16k in 3 class configuration and was much quieter. Food was pretty poor standard on both legs for business class, not worth the premium paid. Also on the return flight I requested a burger from the order as you wish range, however half way through the 12 hour flight the cabin staff were already out of them. I then requested the won ton soup noodle, this also unavailable. The flight attendant offered me a bowl of noodles with, in her words is ""a powdered chicken stock"". I will say the lounges in Hong Kong are superb."

First aircraft told it would be eight hours delayed at check in. Checked this again and it was confirmed. Nearly left the airport. Fortunately did not and went through to the gate as plane was only one hour delayed. Iberia who code shared said everything was ok but Vueling check in staff completely wrong. Plane took ages to load. Have never experienced a smaller seat. Broken arm rest with sharp edges. Pointed it out to staff. Just shrugged. Seat in front clearly leaning back and unable to be put properly upright. Others like it around plane. Far too much hand luggage allowed on board. A shambles. The return. A brand new or near new 320. New style seats. A sense of more room. Staff clearly happier to be on board and basically on time although still far too much hand luggage. Believe I have to fly them again soon as code share on a BA ticket. BA should find better partners.

I asked the agent if it was possible to get a window seat and she did, even though at the online check-in there was none available. Boeing 747-400 was 27 years old, the IFE was the size of my wallet and the quality was incredibly bad. The seats were ok, pretty standard but they had a head rest which was good. My seat was 27A and I had the whole row for myself. Unfortunately a crew member shortly before take-off told me that another passenger had issues with his IFE and they would replace him on 27C. Shortly after take-off the service began. There were 2 food options available. Chicken and vegatarian lasagne, I went for the Lasagne which was ok, nothing special. It came with a salad, a bread bun and a black forest cake. All in all an ok meal, nothing to complain about. The crew distributed 2 mini cans of soda which was a bit unsatisfying. After dinner the crew dimmed the lights and we were supposed to close the window shades for the people who wanted to sleep. I tried to watch some movies (the selection was ok) which was hard on this miniature IFE. In the morning the crew served orange juice and before landing a pretzel with cheese and a small water bottle. Connecting in Heathrow is pretty easy (in T5) there are signs everywhere! Security went fast. There is a huge quiet zone with battery chargers and free WIFI. We boarded again in groups which was good to avoid crowds. BA started to do a buy-on-board service which I hate. However I thought the pricing was ok."

I joined Star Alliance as a Gold Member so at least got to see the Miles and Smiles lounge. BA, look around don't rest on last century's efforts. I've flown BA First but just wouldn't any more. Responding to Skytrax reviews may just help increase profits.

The FA kept hitting my shoulder all night long as she was walking back and forth down the aisle. I asked if they had a self service cart with juice/water and snacks in the back galley like most civilized airlines do and the told me it was not the case on this flight. The meal was really average nothing to scream alleluia about. I will truly go out of my way to avoid this company when flying overseas. Why do they call this aircraft the Dreamliner?

Legroom was horrible you could barely move your legs. The only thing they offer is some complementary beverages, if you want anything to eat you have to pay for it.

Secondly the airport connection in Addis is very chaotic without any notification from the airport staff, passengers have to figure their own way out. The seats on the 787 are comfortable enough but if the airline does not take care, in a few months the electronics may fall apart. The management must ensure that they improve the friendliness of stewards towards the passengers and try to get to the standards of the other International airlines in order to make a bigger name in Africa."

The flight was very good, we embarked with 20â€™ delay due to late arrival of the plane from Ibiza, but we recovered time on flight and we arrived on time to Palma. A new A321 configured with the new seats has proper space for legs including travelling in the last rows. Service during the flight was good, flight attendants doing a very good job. Vueling has no free service, so food and refreshments have to be paid. Checking and control at Orly airport was smooth. The worst is the hall 1 of the airport, really small for such big number of flights departing from this area that make a mess the boarding. Impossible to understand what the personal said through the speakers because the bad quality of the sound, but this is a problem of the airport and not of Vueling.

This flight was cheap, but not cheap enough for what was awful service, surrounded by very noisy travellers - they shout across the middle aisles, walk around when seatbelt sign is on and staff just ignore it.

I've seen a review where a traveler paid a little over 100 dollars for a flight but ended up spending 600 with ""hidden"" fees - there are no hidden fees. All their fees are advertised on the website. If I occasionally do need to check a bag, I pay 26 dollars each way (at time of booking). It's a few dollars more afterward.

Shortly into our journey we had a bit of turbulence so the seat belt sign came on and stayed on a very long time the turbulence only lasted about 10minutes. Eventually the trolley service started and when it reached us in row 14 no sandwiches left. We arrived at Gatwick approx 20 minutes late and then to wait 20minutes for a stand and when we did get a stand crew not interested in saying goodbye - poor return crew."
yes,10,5,5,5,5,5,5,Cathay Pacific Airways,Family Leisure,Economy Class,2022,4,777-300ER,,,Chicago,Bangkok,Hong Kong,True," Chicago to Bangkok via Hong Kong. Cathay Pacific was higher than my expectations. The ground staff at Chicago and Hong Kong were very friendly and helpful. On the Boeing 777, the seats were very comfortable with an adjustable head rest and amazing recline. The cabin crew were very friendly and happy to help us at times. The food service on board was exquisite. They have a huge menu consisting of many vegetarian and non-vegetarian meals, such as shrimp, basa fillet, and lasagna. The entertainment system on board is very modern and has some of the most popular and recent movies, however, even with the entertainment system, I was still unable to complete school work because WiFi is only available on the A350, but overall, Cathay Pacific exceeded my expectations and I would definitely fly with them again."
yes,10,4,5,5,5,5,5,Turkish Airlines,Family Leisure,Economy Class,2022,2,777-300ER,,,ZRH,LAX,IST,True," Zurich to Los Angeles via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. Great price, awesome food and cabin service, smooth flight and on time. Very easy change of flights in Istanbul. I'd choose Turkish Airlines again to fly ."
no,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,British Airways,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,2022,9,777,,,JFK,Manchester,LHR,,"I used British Airways to Hong Kong in 2012 and remember vowing to never use them again. However, as I needed to get to New York and back quickly I had to use British Airways, and I thought they may have bucked up their ideas. The flight to NYC was on a Boeing 747 which really did need an uplift, the seats and decor was tired and the staff rude. The entertainment system was terrible and limited. On the return flight, I was on a Boeing 777 and although slightly more modern, the entertainment again was limited and the control unit didn't work. The staff were better than the previous flight. However British Airways did manage to mislay my baggage between NYC and Manchester and I received it 24hours later (battered and missing some clips and thankfully nothing broken inside). I've decided that whenever I fly eastw I'll continue using Emirates or Singapore Airlines (both of a far higher quality than British Airways) and to the USA maybe Virgin (have to be better than BA surely?). I'll never use BA again."
yes,10,5,5,5,5,5,5,Aeromexico,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,2022,9,737-800,,,Mexico City,Boston,,True," Mexico City to Boston. A very nice and quite new airplane with Boeing Sky interior, different lighting schemes that help you relax. The food was good, (free full meal including beer and spirits). AM Plus (Premium economy) was quite nice and spacious. The overhead bins had a different configuration that made the cabin more spacious too. The flight crew were quite attentive and came offering different services during the flight (meals, duty free sale, drinks and water). Used WiFi for almost three hours and allowed me to work and stay in touch with the ground. We were traveling with a baby and AeroMexico offers a baby bassinet service."
yes,9,4,5,5,4,4,5,Air France,Family Leisure,Economy Class,2022,12,777-200,,,Buenos Aires,Paris,,True, Flew Air France from Buenos Aires to Paris. Very nice flight. Travelling long haul with my 2 year old daughter alone for the first time. I got the flight with airmiles from the Brazilian airline GOL for a very good price especially considering it was the week of Christmas. I was able to use the Aerolineas Argentinas lounge at EZE which was well equipped. Boarding was efficient and having taken our seats the purser came up to introduce himself to me (I am Flying Blue Platinum) which I thought was a nice touch. Food was very nice and my daughters child meal was exceptional. Seats were for economy as good as can be with sufficient leg room for me (I am 6 feet 2). Flight was punctual. Horrendous turbulence which caused distress to some passengers which was very professionally dealt with by the crew. Recently moved to Skyteam from One World and each time I fly with Air France / KLM / Alitalia / Delta I become increasingly pleased that I did. Thanks Air France for making my Christmas happy!
no,2,3,1,1,1,2,3,South African Airways,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,2022,3,A340-600,,,New York City,Johannesburg,,True," Flew New York City to Johannesburg. Overall I could not have been more disappointed in this flight and airplane. For a 15 hour flight, the majority of the headphones jacks did not work and there was no option to use different headphones. There was no way to charge devices and no offer of internet (even at a charge). The crew was incredibly rude. We asked for water when they were serving coffee and got a strong eye roll even though water was on their cart. It was very disheartening. The food was packaged months ago and the majority of it made me nauseous from the smell. The only benefit to this flight was the cost however next time we will be paying the extra to fly Delta from Atlanta. It is time for South African Airways to update this plane or to only use it for shorter trips. It is just simply too out of date for this time of trip and is not fair to customers."
yes,8,5,5,4,4,3,4,Turkish Airlines,Business,Business Class,2022,6,A330-200,,,LOS,ATH,IST,,"Flew Business Class from Lagos to Athens via Istanbul. Had a 20 minute delay, but despite that, no other negatives. The airplane was very new and clean and Cabin Crew were very kind and welcoming. Welcome drinks made the beginning of the flight pleasant. The new entertainment system for Turkish Airlines was very nice with good movies and music even though I would have liked a wider music selection. Food was fabulous, and seat reclined into a full bed. No turbulence through the flight."
