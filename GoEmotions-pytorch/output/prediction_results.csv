My window was dirty, my headrest and my pillow covers were not changed (covers in fabric so passengers cannot always notice it, but the smell was just terrible. The blanket was the one used for the previous flight (just folded on the seat, not sealed in a plastic bag as it should be). When I asked for a ""clean blanket"" the FA did not really seem to realize what I meant. Extremely disappointed by these kind of practices. I usually have issues with Asiana regarding dirty windows so I usually ask the FA a wet tissue to clean it. When traveling on a legacy airline, cleanliness is an issue for me, since it's basic respect for passengers. By comparison, I flew Korean Air several times and never had such issues. Take off at 00:40 and ""dinner"" served at 2am. Seriously, the only things passengers want to do at this time is to sleep. FA woke up all the passengers by asking them to put up their seats. Choice was not appropriate - porridge or sea food. I did not take any of them. A breakfast, before arriving at Incheon would have been more suitable. The quantity of movies loaded in the IFE is just a huge joke. The movie application is divided into themes and in Hollywood or classics you would find only have 3 to 4 movies.",0.009912692,0.0016561719,0.0017704042,0.10809656,0.021275677,0.002673325,0.007798352,0.0013636163,0.00085851725,0.7958674,0.25558162,0.0063537764,0.0029142227,0.00053598714,0.000502597,0.0010835159,0.0010584849,0.0022435703,0.00040229727,0.0017846548,0.0036185053,0.0005656831,0.085704595,0.0038262806,0.0053207963,0.009468963,0.0018028548,0.1531404,disappointment,0.7958674,disapproval,0.25558162,neutral,0.1531404

It seems seats in the last row in PE have better recline than the other two rows. Seats arranged in 2x3x2 configuration. Seat with foot rest, fairly comfortable with good recline. PE cabin completely full. Shared bathrooms with economy cabin. IFE screens good size maybe 11 or 12 inches seem a little larger than iPad. Good contents plenty to watch to kill time. Cabin clean and tidy, bathrooms kept fully stocked and clean. Flight scheduled to depart Hong Kong at 10:20 AM but delayed to 10:35 AM and finally departed after 11am. Arrived into Melbourne after 11pm about 40 minutes late. Pre departure drinks offered but no champagne only water and juices. Hot towel offered only once be nice to have another hot towel service prior to arrival. Once airborne lunch service began. Pre ordered vegetarian meal and served first but after finished with meal stuck with tray for the next hour as cabin crew was serving the rest of the economy cabin before returning to clear trays. Drinks offered multiple times. A male cabin crew addressed passengers by name and introduced himself, very pleasant and professional. Pre arrival meals served two hours before landing. Overall an above average flight with friendly and professional cabin crew. Only minor complaint Cathay Pacific does not know the different between vegan and vegetarian meals. If you order vegetarian meal chances are you will get a vegan meal of pasta with salad and no dressing for main meal and some sort of greasy grilled vegetables with soggy potato wedges as pre landing meal.

A chaotic check in experience for a packed flight at CDG. Boarding was supposed to be via zone, but when boarding time came at CDG it was every man for himself. Basically it was organized chaos. Passengers boarded with hand luggage that did not fit into the overhead compartments, and I ended up helping the cabin crew repack the compartments to fit everything in, as I am quite tall. The flight from CDG to ADD was the noisiest, smelliest flight I have ever been on, and 4 hours into the 6.5 hour journey, I wanted to use the toilet. The floor and toilet was covered in urine and toilet paper. I reported this to the cabin crew and nothing was done about it. The interior was the the most tired and dated I have been on, and my inflight entertainment was working on and off. Food service was abysmal, and after service the crew disappeared for the rest of the flight. The aircraft was quite dirty and one of the overhead bins opened in ADD when we were slammed into the ground upon landing. The leg from ADD to JNB was also in a 777-200LR, but on the upside it was quite empty. Meal service on this leg was a snack and a lunch and from all the meals this was passable. Service in general was OK, but nothing to rave about. In general the whole Ethiopian experience left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I would suggest that the airline focus on customer service, and do something to fix abysmal ADD airport before they consider expanding further. A more modern cabin refresh wouldn't hurt either.",0.02240177,0.001524139,0.0044578733,0.17944343,0.034474153,0.0052904324,0.0025424869,0.00076112454,0.0007325993,0.087894775,0.034260627,0.082953624,0.00485013,0.0021451388,0.0016472923,0.0018555517,0.0014646093,0.007870464,0.00010114759,0.0010478243,0.00990235,0.0058160704,0.038461916,0.015447038,0.0034482693,0.00531151,0.0012835214,0.32972357,neutral,0.32972357,annoyance,0.17944343,disappointment,0.087894775

I consider this flight an excellent choice for having sufficient time in the morning in Christchurch to have brunch with family before flying home. Check in effortless at Christchurch Airport. Made use of Koru Lounge prior to boarding with Koru membership. Boarding quick. Aircraft perhaps 85% full. Once loaded, an unexpected 30 minute delay occurred. However, flight landed in Brisbane 15 minutes early. The only male flight attendant presented as disinterested, appearing unhappy and 'going through the motions.' Female flight attendants were positively engaged in their occupation. Food offerings consisted of two hot meals for 'The Works' passengers. The beef, rice and vegetable option was tasty enough for airline food. However portion small. It has been noted on a number of Air New Zealand flights taken recently that soft drinks are not served by the can, but rather out of the can and into the plastic cup by the flight attendants. While innocent in service to passengers, this is portion control by any description and therefore Air New Zealand cost cutting. I have also noticed that when the Customer Service Manager reads the offerings out across the PA, there is no mention of soft drinks, only tea, coffee and water. Bags out on belt within 15 minutes at Brisbane Airport. While I consider Air New Zealand to be a good airline, they pale in comparison to Qantas with service delivery.

The New York to Chicago flight was nice trip and bumpy so service was suspended for safety reasons. Chicago to Vancouver a nasty air crew looking to upset customers. We sat in the third row or first of premium economy. We were ordered shortly after take off not to congregate or line up for toilets in the rear. Since we were up front making it to the toilet without anyone getting in front of you was impossible. Due to this fact I did not drink on aircraft as at 65 it can be painful to wait. We were offered no food as promised for our two hungry boys. They did get a third of a can of Sprite as this was their second long flight they asked for another drink of Sprite. They were refused. My wife asked for water instead politely. I asked for the purser to request an additional sprite as United advertises complimentary beverages. He did deliver. I thanked him profusely but now I was unbeknownst to me a marked man. I sat quietly until I was in dire need of a toilet. There were eight people in first class all sitting comfortably so I quickly used the front toilet. You would think I had threatened the aircraft. When I exited I was berated and demeaned by that same purser and ordered back to my seat. Where else I would go at 36,000 feet in the air was a mystery to me. I complied without incident. I did tell him quietly before landing he was a rude man for embarrassing me for using a toilet. On arrival the pilot came bounding out of the cockpit and had requested security at the gate. A toilet offense had apparently endangered the aircraft in some ridiculous fashion. He proceeded to lie about me talking to staff which had not happened. I was accused of blocking the aisle which had not happened. The security personnel dismissed the incident and we all went home.

We paid extra for the elite plus package. The 3rd row we had on the way down was ideal. We got the first row on the way back, it was the worst, you couldnâ€™t move the arm rest and itâ€™s annoying to have no place to put your bags. On the way down, we had a rowdy, loud couple who never stopped talking. It was annoying until around 11pm and just ignorant after that as it would have been nice to have a little nap given we werenâ€™t getting to our hotel until 3-4am. The flight attendants did nothing to get them to be quiet, rather, they participated in the shenanigans. If I had my kids with me, I would have been extremely upset. On the way back, the same couple was on the plane and were still talking the whole way home. We left Cuba after 3am so everyone wanted to sleep and these people never shut up. Again, no one from sunwing said anything to them. Grow a back bone for your other passengers flight comfort and say something to these people please! As for the resort, it was amazing. However, Sunwing was paid by us for a 7 day stay. We really got more like 6 and a few hours because of the time our flight came in. I would recommend you ask Sunwing about this. Our check in time for our resort was 3pm March 2nd. We hadnâ€™t even left Edmonton until 5:45pm that same day. Our flight home was at 3:35am on March 10th. We had to vacate our room at 12pm on March 9th meaning we had no room to stay in for 11 hours before the bus came to take us to the airport. When we spoke to the resort, they said sometimes when Sunwing does this, they pay for the room or negotiate late check out. They did nothing of the sort. The resort however took care of us and we checked out at 4pm and were offered a courtesy room in case we wanted to freshen up before the flight. That was 100% because we spoke to a wonderful man named Oscar who helps run the resort. When I went to the front desk, they basically said thatâ€™s what sunwing paid for so if we hadnâ€™t found Oscar, we would have been screwed. Iâ€™ve stayed once in Cuba before and had the exact same flight situation but we got to keep our room until we left. This is why I will book through that company in the future. Iâ€™ve had so many issues with Sunwing that I havenâ€™t booked with them in 4 years and I never will again.

The staff seemed to have no interest in the guests traveling. The service was efficient but cold. Certainly room for improvement for a so-called leading airline. I would not recommend Emirates if traveling in business class. There are alternative airlines that with great products and personalized service where you will have a more well rounded experience.,0.21361549,0.00056160294,0.0030441543,0.039702274,0.035146195,0.008697696,0.0052663004,0.003705517,0.0037128152,0.88830113,0.110695526,0.006867735,0.004926492,0.0047143474,0.0018172495,0.007878786,0.0056319125,0.0047464115,0.0022987528,0.007546238,0.0067883115,0.0033162662,0.0932916,0.014034295,0.030397968,0.048162635,0.003681158,0.021263806,disappointment,0.88830113,admiration,0.21361549,disapproval,0.110695526

no,1,1,2,1,1,2,1,flydubai,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,2022,2,737-800MAX,,,Dubai,Zanzibar,,False," We had booked a return flight with Emirates, from Glasgow to Zanzibar via Dubai on 27th February and returning on 7th March. After confirming our booking, we found that the 6 hour leg from Dubai to Zanzibar is operated by FlyDubai, which turns out to be a low cost (but not particularly cheap) airline. The Emirates flights to and from Glasgow to Dubai on a 777-300 were excellent in all respects but we can honestly say that in all our years of travelling, the FlyDubai flights in a Boeing 737-800MAX were probably the worst we have ever taken. By booking with Emirates, we not unreasonably expected to get at least a roughly comparable standard of service and amenities. We believe that Emirates should make it clearer when booking that an associated connecting flight is operated by a budget airline, and a poor one at that. There were so many things wrong that itâ€™s difficult to know where to start but here goes: The seats were really very cramped, with a nominal pitch of 30â€ but I suspect that in reality itâ€™s a bit less than this. Furthermore, the seats were quite hard and our backsides started to suffer after a couple of hours. Theyâ€™ve tried to cram in as many passengers as possible and whilst this may be just bearable for short haul flights, itâ€™s a disgrace to use this configuration for what was a long haul flight. It was obvious that many passengers, and more especially the taller ones, were really suffering. The aisle was very narrow, and passengers in aisle seats were being constantly bumped into while trying to sleep. The cabin on both the outbound and return flights was terribly stuffy and airless. Air con was either not working properly, or not set up correctly. People were asking for water but had to pay for it! Absolutely disgraceful! As we were on an Emirates ticket, we were entitled to complimentary meals, but other passengers had to pay. The meals were truly awful and pretty much inedible. In flight entertainment is available but has to be paid for, even for those on an Emirates ticket. FlyDubai operates from Terminal 2 which entails a painfully slow 40 minute bus transfer from Terminal 3 â€“ this is pretty nail-biting if you have a tight connection, as we did. All in all, a horrible experience that we never wish to repeat and we can categorically state that we will never use FlyDubai again, and nor will we book with Emirates if they use them for connecting flights.

London Heathrow to Dubai started off well as I only had hand luggage so getting to gate was a breeze thanks to Emirates easy and intuitive mobile check-in. It all went downhill from here though. On boarding was clear my ICE seat back screen was not working or responding. Worse it wouldn't switch off and kept flickering. I informed a member of the cabin crew about the issue but there wasn't a lot of enthusiasm or effort made to help. I asked if could be switched off if it could not be made to work, and never heard anything for the rest of the flight leaving me with flickering screen to contend with for 8 hours which was distracting and didn't really help me sleep on a night flight. I understand things go wrong and am reasonable but its how you handle things that matters. Once over Dubai, landing was delayed and we were put in holding pattern for 1.5 hours due to fog. We were informed that ground staff would be on hand to help those with missed connections and those that had tight ones to make and I was relieved at first to see a lot of staff about. However it seemed they were only helping certain people and when I asked, I got yelled at very disrespecftfully to go look at the departure board. I was left to fend for myself when I only had 20 minutes to get my gate for the flight to Dhaka which was showing as ""Final Call"". Infuriated and out of breath I arrived at the gate just in time to be met with a surly and unapologetic gate staff. I was then shoved on bus in the Dubai heat and we were left there for half an hour without any updates past take-off time. We were then bussed to the cargo terminal where our plane was parked and boarded and then left for a further 45 minutes without much information. The saving grace of the DXB-DAC sector was the crew were quite friendly and warm, and unusually the catering was rather nice. Returning DAC-DXB, even getting into the aiport was a nightmare due the corruption and difficulties that have returned with using Dhaka airport and the use of the local airlines Biman handling team is slow and innefficient. The hassling for money of my elderly mother from her requested assistance was also unwelcome. The flight itself DAC-DXB was uneventful, but the food was atrocious even by Emirates standards - almost inedible. Thas was repeated on the DXB-NCL sector as well. All in all very much going downhill, even the hard product is showing some weariness and there's complacency in improvements on these - the 10 abreast seating on Boeing 777's is horrific.

I was really disappointed with Aer Lingus because the plane was incredibly uncomfortable. It was the first flight in years where actually sitting in the seats was deeply uncomfortable. And I do mean seats. I had to move twice as my first seat had a broken headphone connection, the second seat was in a weird location with fixed sides so I couldn't move my hips at all and twisted my back. I was surprised by how many people had major issues with their entertainment screen and I was surprised by how poor it was. The touchscreen was more like ""hit it 4 or 5 times"" screen and watch it go to the wrong thing. I had to use the remote to navigate and it still did not register after 3 times of hitting the button. I gave up after one show because the headphones (a double prong jack so I couldn't use my own headphones) sounded like people talking into a tin can. Everything felt so outdated. I spent a good time out of my seat toward the end of the flight trying to help my back recover. Another bizarre thing was how often they interrupted the entertainment system (or in many people's case sleep) to give inane commentary or play an advert (!) for something Irish or a charity partner. That's find at the end of the flight but in the middle of the night over and over again? It's such a shame as the connection through Dublin was lovely and the short hop to Berlin was just fine, but I just won't be putting my body through that again for long haul.",0.010454786,0.0027419406,0.003812992,0.01218129,0.003483648,0.0022549445,0.0055003124,0.0048127226,0.005252614,0.21147749,0.022569802,0.002717657,0.022376148,0.024263602,0.003156736,0.0017794736,0.0030081286,0.005337851,0.001309411,0.008107174,0.037372183,0.002268876,0.13282257,0.0053265053,0.002976072,0.01582119,0.80893207,0.0152751235,surprise,0.80893207,disappointment,0.21147749,realization,0.13282257

First time flying BA after flying Qatar, Emirates and Oman Air business class. Check in at BAH was quick and efficient with their seperate business and first class check in area. BA uses the Dilmun lounge, which is basic but adequate. The flight from BAH to LHR was on a 777. The seats are in a 2x4x2 configuration and are very narrow (similar to premium economy seats, and marginally larger than the economy seats) though reasonably comfortable. When fully flat there is not much room, and people over 6 feet will struggle. There was hardly any storage space, and the IFE screen was very small and of poor quality. The food was very average (I had the carrot and pumpkin soup). Cabin crew was disengaged and the plane felt old and tired. The lounge in Heathrow is large, but gets too busy to be able to sit comfortably. The bathrooms in both the main BA lounges are quite dated and need a good clean far more often then they get. The quality of food in the lounge is average, though the wine and spirit selection is decent. The flight from LHR to BOS was on a 747 and this was similar to the 777 - old and tired with cramped seating for business class. Cabin crew were a bit better on this leg, though still disengaged. The food was of average quality, though the wine list, while small, was good. Overall, BA has the feel of a budget carrier compared to some of its middle eastern counterparts. The lounge is sub par, particularly when compared to the Qatar lounge in Doha, or even the Qantas / One World lounge in LAX. The business class ticket was reasonably cheap, though I can now see why.

Problem was that for half of the flight the IFE wasn't working, but when it did it had plenty of movies, games, music etc. We received a warm sandwich and dessert on this flight which were tasty along with a good seletion of drinks, only problem was that only 1 drinks round was made. Second flight was on a Boeing 737-800 which was a bit older and only had screens above our heads, but it was a 55 minute flight (on the way back this flight was operated by A321-200 with IFE) and even on this short flight we received drinks and food (same sandwich just no dessert). Overall these were really nice flights and I would fly with Turkish again. The A321 was really nice and IFE for 2 hours flight is great, it is just the crew that could be little bit better.",0.89907634,0.0007262798,0.00022664692,0.0023316804,0.11933266,0.0031649033,0.0011332381,0.0012102512,0.0011109642,0.006478981,0.0029618063,0.0010148266,0.00021389201,0.029000316,0.00043784975,0.013665086,0.00046286383,0.045398403,0.0006497849,0.00041372905,0.008198573,0.0073934617,0.013689309,0.008018431,0.00074393605,0.0012929406,0.0022910293,0.043690424,admiration,0.89907634,approval,0.11933266,joy,0.045398403

I like Vienna airport for it is small, efficient and convenient. Austrian Airlines is exactly the same. On this 8+ hour night flight from Toronto to Vienna I had a very memorable experience. Because of the change of equipment from what I expected, I ended up sitting in row 7 which has no window. I wasnâ€™t happy! But since it was a night flight and I was going to sleep for most of it I thought I wonâ€™t make a fuss. During dinner service, when the flight attendant asked me if everything was OK, I said yes, adding that it would be great if she could do something about the missing window - jokingly. Well, when I woke up in the morning I look up, and on the wall where the window was supposed to be I had a painting of a window with a beautiful sunrise drawn on it in vibrant colours. Along with a very sweet note from the flight attendant that was serving me. Made my flight! That is attention to detail. Although Austrian doesnâ€™t have the newest planes (Boeing 767-300) and the latest latest business class product, itâ€™s very solid, with great service and some of the best inflight catering Iâ€™ve ever had. I actually look forward to all my meals that are prepared by the onboard chef. To end, there is the substantial Austrian coffee menu, which I adore.

We did not upgrade to even more space, but he still had plenty of legroom and was very comfortable in a normal seat!",0.04520745,0.0031776908,0.00036515234,0.0015386957,0.08359177,0.040322624,0.0009704881,0.0011673989,0.013423656,0.0011834432,0.0023615519,0.000715029,0.00024332959,0.062317103,0.00052604097,0.056424562,0.00070402876,0.69181395,0.0050046723,0.0007017717,0.030386765,0.0026204363,0.0074867895,0.021849034,0.0006147236,0.00068833487,0.0006598435,0.048039988,joy,0.69181395,approval,0.08359177,excitement,0.062317103
yes,10,5,5,5,5,5,5,China Southern Airlines,Solo Leisure,Business Class,2022,8,A330-200,,,CAN,AMS,,True," I'm quite satisfied with China Southern Airlines cabin service for my trip in business class from Guangzhou to Amsterdam. The VIP lounge in Guangzhou airport was of perfect setting, various drinks and food provided. The attendants showed patience to us during boarding. Because the traditional Chinese Mid-Autumn festival is on the way, they offered us Chinese tea and delicious mooncakes as desserts. Since I am a big fan of Chinese culture, I took some pictures under their permission. Enough leg rest room in the seat helped me to get a good sleep in 13 hours. A personal toiletry kit was provided in every business passenger seat.

yes,9,4,5,4,3,4,4,Air Canada rouge,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,2022,9,767-300,,,YYZ,EDI,,True," I have just completed my 10th flight with Air Canada rouge in their premium rouge class. I have never tried rouge or rouge plus offerings therefore I cannot comment on them. I have used premium rouge every year over the Toronto - Edinburgh route since they started in 2013. All flights have been on their B767-300. Rouge is ACs Leisure airline with lower operating costs than mainline AC, it is not advertised as a low cost carrier. It is however clearly advertised on the AC web site as a different product to mainline AC. My tip would be to do some research before you travel. On this trip I checked in at Bermuda as I was on a through ticket BDA/YYZ/EDI. Boarding at YYZ followed the standard AC arrangements with premium rouge passengers boarding in group 2. I was given a warm welcome on board having been recognized by a crew member from a previous rouge flight. The seat has similar pitch and width to those used on AC mainline business class service in N. America. (Including Bermuda & Caribbean) Each premium passenger had a small overnight amenity kit and bottled water on the seat waiting for them. Tablets for the rouge IFE system were handed out by FAs prior to departure. The use of these is included in the premium package. Departure from YYZ was a couple of minutes early and once in the air dinner menus were handed out. There was a choice of two main dishes. The drinks and meal service appeared much more professional in its presentation and co-ordination than it was in the â€˜earlyâ€™ days of rouge. The table ware is exactly the same as in ACs N. American business having experienced this on the earlier BDA/YYZ sector. The only issue on the flight was an un-serviceable washroom at the front of the plane. We were directed to use the facility mid-cabin. One of these, clearly for use by disabled passengers, was the biggest aircraft washroom I have every used. I managed about 2 hours light sleep or doze before a light breakfast of banana cake, juice tea/coffee was served. Arrival at EDI was a few minutes early. I continue to recommend AC premium rouge for a short (ish) trans Atlantic flight, in fact I have another premium rouge flight booked for March over DUB/YYZ, unfortunately the EDI service is summer seasonal only which for me is a bit of an niggle.",0.01930665,0.0008749194,0.00080033485,0.0019191143,0.016124882,0.0023063712,0.0014783011,0.0013689826,0.00089040276,0.0008304465,0.004971162,0.00056621607,0.00038237264,0.0037824037,0.0003276427,0.017739799,0.0002901968,0.0035931207,0.0006428641,0.0001182224,0.0019334761,0.0014764208,0.005331227,0.0013820344,0.0007826758,0.00036927513,0.00072710705,0.9585277,neutral,0.9585277,admiration,0.01930665,gratitude,0.017739799

Seating the same on both aircraft, very comfortable with good legroom and reasonable seat width. Felt more cramped on the A350. Crew professional and friendly on both legs. Good meal services on both flights, although I note on daylight flights in this case London to Doha the meal service and offering is much more extensive than on the early morning flights 0230am from Doha to Singapore. Inflight entertainment good and extensive choice not just of Western movies/tv but content from around the world. The Oryx IFE system they use is not that user friendly and can be clumsy. 15 minutes free wifi offered on both flights, but no point in using as the system times out constantly. Bathrooms kept clean throughout both flights. Only real negatives about experience, very long and drawn out safety announcements done in both Arabic and English but not simultaneously, way too much advertising of Qatar Airways, Qatar banks etc. Inflight entertainment interrupted too many times with charity videos and arrival videos for Doha.

Fortunately, we still managed to take off more or less on time. The cabin crew responsible for our side of the First cabin was personable but lacked experience. The food served for dinner was a mixture of good and mediocre. Warm salmon on ice cold salad is never a pleasant experience. The seats in First are reasonably comfortable although they lack the privacy of competitors' premium cabin. The duvet was made redundant because of the typically overheated cabin. One of the First toilets was out of action so we had to make use of the Club World loos upstairs. It would have been helpful if cabin crew had apologised for the inconvenience for the lack of the convenience, but no comment was made. The IFE was passable and the sound quality good if one's own noise cancelling headphones are used. WiFi was available but I didn't make use of it. Breakfast was unremarkable and I wish bread rather than pastries was offered. Deplaning was delayed by half-an-hour because of early morning congestion at T5 and the lack of a stand.

Flew from Santiago de Compostela on Iberia Express to Madrid yesterday to connect to our Iberia flight to New York. I can see why Iberia Express gets its 'most punctual airline' reputation. Boarding was swift, very organized and we departed about 5mins ahead of schedule. On board, sadly there wasn't much to say except the legroom was very tight and even a coffee had to be paid for. The crew seemed pleasant and helpful. I was however, not able to connect to the advertised free streaming entertainment at all. Not a huge deal breaker as it was a short flight. I had decided to take up an email offer to upgrade my next sector to New York and was so glad I did. Having priority boarding as a part of it was a huge plus on this maxed out A340-600. I loved the Premium Economy seat with the extra recline and legroom was great. It's a fresh, relatively small, more private cabin than the wild expanse of regular economy. The larger, responsive, IFE screen worked well and had just enough options to keep me occupied for 7 hours. The very slightly upgraded meal (main served in a china dish) was fairly decent thought it took quite a while after take off before it was served. There was no bar service before this. The crew were warm and pleasant though and seemed to be constantly working. We sat in row 15 which is only slightly ahead of the galley, so could hear everything and the light from the galley was distracting at times. The pre-arrival snack of a boxed sandwich was fine and we arrived only slightly late into JFK. All in all, I'd recommend Iberia's Premium Economy if you do get an email offer to upgrade.

Firstly I have to say the crew on the flight were super in every way. Nothing was too much trouble and they seemed to genuinely be enjoying their work. I should have given my 'BA Golden Ticket' to one of them but forgot. However no matter how good the crew, it cannot make up for everything else being totally awful and shabby. The seat was filthy with what looked like ketchup from the previous flight and crumbs everywhere. Not a nice start. The aircraft was very very old - a lot of the interior was patched up with white gum. The IFE didn't work properly. Amenity kit was a bag and the headsets poor quality. The toilets (compared to AA) were small unpleasant. Seat is not up to most Business class standard. Food was awful and the 'club kitchen' almost non-existent.

The plane seemed aged, seats were not comfy, narrow for 10 hours flight. It could be my luck getting an older plane, and it could be different with newer planes for the same route. Check-in to the flight was a complete mess. Instead of calling with zones or Tier everyone invited to open counters, and it caused huge line ups and mess in the plane. Cabin staff was nice, courteous but not helpful. They lied about foods to people especially who were not a native speaker of Turkish. They passed, drinks and food items over passengers heads to their colleague if they were out on their carts. I felt extremely warm in my seat. Complained about it and the answer was this is the coldest they can get at this altitude for maximum air quality in the cabin. The final part is that 2 of my luggage get lost on this flight, Turkish Airlines cannot locate my luggage, and each representative over the phone tells different location.

Nice amenity kit. Pillow ok (a bit small) and nice comforter. The video screen was large and the IFE selection was excellent. Food was disappointing - bland and overcooked. Wine and champagne selection was good. International airport lounge in Mexico City closed early at 10pm and they had us move to a very crowded domestic lounge farther away from the gates. The second lounge was dirty, wines were not re-stocked and food was sparse. It was a mess. The cabin staff was the rudest I have ever experienced in business class on any airline. Bare minimum. Rarely came through the cabin. I was not served at dinner, asked for a meal and a drink after waiting over an hour and was treated very rudely.

Check in and security at MNL was quick, considering the outbound flight was at 0500. After a quick stop to the lounge, it was a bit of a walk to gate 111 where there was quite a crowd boarding but the business lane was pretty quick getting onboard. Regional configuration in the MNL-HKG leg with good and warm service. Food was passable and forgettable, as can be expected by CX catering. After a 3 hour transit, the long HKG-ORD leg for a quick business trip to Chicago. Previously flew the A359 and the business seats on the 773 was a bit of a letdown compared to the fantastic newer product (it's a shame if the rumors are true that CX will change the business seats of the 359). Nonetheless, the reverse herringbone layout allows for great privacy and the seat provides numerous storage options for large and small items. Catering was better than the first leg with very responsive service and very unobtrusive for those who want to sleep. Special mention to the chief purser who made the service a joy. IFE was a bit of a letdown as well, but I suppose it was just that the selection of movies, while extensive, did not contain those that appealed to me. On the return leg, the company messed up the connecting day which was resolved very quickly on the ground in ORD. In-flight service to HKG and MNL was more robotic and less warm. They have a good business product, but for an Asian airline, I think it could up its game a little bit to play with the other big boys in the region (Singapore, ANA, Asiana).",0.23131113,0.00059463974,0.0003287215,0.0037409249,0.1277976,0.0038600382,0.0024148505,0.00076442456,0.00052061427,0.0028602781,0.005753565,0.001498697,0.0008071836,0.00176006,0.00024424304,0.019597804,0.00035347362,0.003253575,0.00051455206,0.00014475081,0.0055989786,0.005374177,0.02494251,0.005293412,0.0018318604,0.00061660353,0.00062812486,0.7347692,neutral,0.7347692,admiration,0.23131113,approval,0.1277976

First off, they cancelled my original flight home. So, I had to spend an extra night in Lisbon, which was actually a little fun. I got to walk around Lisbon, and I had a great dinner. TAP covered the hotel bill and it was okay. With that said, they promised to cover us for dinner, which never happened, but breakfast was included. They also provided transport. As for the flights, they could have been better. Food was so so, but you could get free beer or wine. Seats were uncomfortable. Also, beware of paying extra for seats. They switched airplanes on my flight to Lisbon, and didn't bother to switch my seat to the emergency row-even thought I paid 65 Euro for it. In the end, I got an emergency row seat, but not the one I wanted and paid for. On the way back to America, I got the proper emergency row seat, but the in-flight entertainment didn't work for me, despite several attempts to reset it. With this all in mind, the flights did fly on time, and my flight back to the US was early, which helped with my connection. All things considered, I would not fly this airline again if I can help it. Too much trouble, and I was one of the lucky ones. I was part of a tour of Morocco where everyone flew TAP, and many people were out hundreds of dollars with the one-day delayed flight.

The good thing is that they are fully flat, the bad thing is that they do not all offer direct aisle access (and that there are 3 seats together in the middle row in business class). That said, I also have to say that the Buenos Aires - Istanbul flight is very long because of the stop in Sao Paulo, but flying business class in TK makes it seem shorter, the IFE is quite good and the food is great. I take this flight twice a year and even though the food service deteriorated a bit lately, it is still very good compared to other airlines (unfortunately on my last flights there was no more amuse bouche, no more many options of starters to pick from the trolley and no more final trolley with coffee and petit fours-the latter was now consolidated with the dessert trolley, also the champagne on board was downgraded from Taittinger to Mumm). As I said the meals service is still good but it could be a lot better if flight attendants would be more proactive at offering drinks and refills. They just do not do it, you need to call them every time you need a refill (it does not happen in many other airlines) and when you do they take forever and it is obvious are not willing to do it. Overall, I would recommend TK business class because the food is very good and the seats are confortable, but they need to improve the service on board.

Business priority class. Everything went wrong from the moment we have arrived to the airport to check-in. flydubai supervisor let us check in without a word about any problem. But I could hear something about late taking off to another customer who wanted to go to passport control. I had to go to her and ask her directly, if the information of flight delay is correct. She said: Yes, approximately 4 hours of being delayed. I went to her again and ask her if it is true, because we are having a meeting in Dubai, hotel confirmed and we are going to see the New YearÂ´s fireworks. She answered: It is your problem. You must be comming earlier. When it was 17:30 pm, there was a sign on departure schedule board: Dubai FZ780: departure 23:00. No one came to us, no info what is happening etc. After my asking to airport staff I was answered that there is a thick fog at DXB airport (but plane is from 15:30 at Prague airport). FlyDubai supervisor wasnÂ´t at her office and no one could reach her. No official info from flydubai representative. It was a really poor apology and answer about the fog. Turkish airlines, Emirates with the big airbus, SwissAir, SmartWings and many other flights from PRG to DXB were departing and the flights from DXB were landing in PRG. But only FlyDubai customers were sitting on the floor in a hall and waiting hours for new information. I have checked the weather radar at DXB airport from my notebook and the visibility was from 8km to 10km. After another complaining, I got the phone number to flydubai representative help line. No answer, just automatic speech (Thank you for your calling to flydubai, for communication in english press 1 and my call was automaticly cancelled). Help line didnÂ´t help at all. Finally at 22:00 a new schedule of Dubai departure showed PRG to DXB FZ780 FlyDubai: 1:00 am 1st January 2017. I was so upset and annoyed. I realized that my business, hotel reservation and New YearÂ´s firework are totally buried. I wanted my money back and wanted to cancel the journey. When I reached the flydubai representative, I was told that no cancellation is available due to weather conditions. I asked the captain with his crew who were just passing us and arrived to PRG from Africa with stop on DXB and continuing to PRG and he told us, that it is nice and sunny in DXB without any problems. The representative of flydubai told us after this, that pilots need to have a rest and will not fly. After protests of other passangers, they gave us 10 dollars ticket for refreshment, but in Duty free zone there was everything closed because of the New YearÂ´s Eve. At midnight a member of airport came to business lounge and said: The lounge closes normally at 19:00 and it is 24:00 now. Go to the counters down to the hall to the others. Small kids, infants, old people, no matter. At 1:00am next day departure schedule board shows FlyDubai FZ780 to DXB planned departure 7:00 morning.

However, as I needed to get to New York and back quickly I had to use British Airways, and I thought they may have bucked up their ideas. The flight to NYC was on a Boeing 747 which really did need an uplift, the seats and decor was tired and the staff rude. The entertainment system was terrible and limited. On the return flight, I was on a Boeing 777 and although slightly more modern, the entertainment again was limited and the control unit didn't work. The staff were better than the previous flight. However British Airways did manage to mislay my baggage between NYC and Manchester and I received it 24hours later (battered and missing some clips and thankfully nothing broken inside). I've decided that whenever I fly eastw I'll continue using Emirates or Singapore Airlines (both of a far higher quality than British Airways) and to the USA maybe Virgin (have to be better than BA surely?). I'll never use BA again.",0.004441642,0.0003790926,0.00719006,0.23750602,0.04031892,0.004330784,0.019098273,0.0038921486,0.0009741789,0.16591918,0.104657434,0.006803512,0.00601909,0.0005044826,0.00066105387,0.0049244547,0.001003175,0.0008779838,7.448637e-05,0.0012648315,0.009695507,0.0012598579,0.058339104,0.004415212,0.014674207,0.004614174,0.001441017,0.2215854,annoyance,0.23750602,neutral,0.2215854,disappointment,0.16591918
yes,10,5,5,5,5,5,5,Aeromexico,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,2022,9,737-800,,,Mexico City,Boston,,True," Mexico City to Boston. A very nice and quite new airplane with Boeing Sky interior, different lighting schemes that help you relax. The food was good, (free full meal including beer and spirits). AM Plus (Premium economy) was quite nice and spacious. The overhead bins had a different configuration that made the cabin more spacious too. The flight crew were quite attentive and came offering different services during the flight (meals, duty free sale, drinks and water). Used WiFi for almost three hours and allowed me to work and stay in touch with the ground. We were traveling with a baby and AeroMexico offers a baby bassinet service.",0.8936485,0.00039593797,0.00023066897,0.0009820655,0.113179974,0.0036417074,0.0010865616,0.0010504619,0.0005025611,0.0011913645,0.0016022223,0.00044203005,0.000101606674,0.0061276346,0.00021774384,0.01620482,0.00017495672,0.011116685,0.0010699849,0.00011713203,0.0061008856,0.002904069,0.0060761576,0.0019870508,0.0003045709,0.000360027,0.0009769524,0.05471045,admiration,0.8936485,approval,0.113179974,neutral,0.05471045
yes,9,4,5,5,4,4,5,Air France,Family Leisure,Economy Class,2022,12,777-200,,,Buenos Aires,Paris,,True, Flew Air France from Buenos Aires to Paris. Very nice flight. Travelling long haul with my 2 year old daughter alone for the first time. I got the flight with airmiles from the Brazilian airline GOL for a very good price especially considering it was the week of Christmas. I was able to use the Aerolineas Argentinas lounge at EZE which was well equipped. Boarding was efficient and having taken our seats the purser came up to introduce himself to me (I am Flying Blue Platinum) which I thought was a nice touch. Food was very nice and my daughters child meal was exceptional. Seats were for economy as good as can be with sufficient leg room for me (I am 6 feet 2). Flight was punctual. Horrendous turbulence which caused distress to some passengers which was very professionally dealt with by the crew. Recently moved to Skyteam from One World and each time I fly with Air France / KLM / Alitalia / Delta I become increasingly pleased that I did. Thanks Air France for making my Christmas happy!,0.7425969,0.0016272019,0.000591938,0.0014107722,0.017631873,0.004735392,0.0013781696,0.0014660689,0.0005542294,0.00083862647,0.0015774388,0.0008335801,0.0003851149,0.056222178,0.00050728855,0.8662888,0.0004009989,0.11349473,0.0013447002,0.0002728928,0.0053550024,0.010379832,0.0049121655,0.014465639,0.0009876875,0.0005266201,0.0023705538,0.020063452,gratitude,0.8662888,admiration,0.7425969,joy,0.11349473
no,2,3,1,1,1,2,3,South African Airways,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,2022,3,A340-600,,,New York City,Johannesburg,,True," Flew New York City to Johannesburg. Overall I could not have been more disappointed in this flight and airplane. For a 15 hour flight, the majority of the headphones jacks did not work and there was no option to use different headphones. There was no way to charge devices and no offer of internet (even at a charge). The crew was incredibly rude. We asked for water when they were serving coffee and got a strong eye roll even though water was on their cart. It was very disheartening. The food was packaged months ago and the majority of it made me nauseous from the smell. The only benefit to this flight was the cost however next time we will be paying the extra to fly Delta from Atlanta. It is time for South African Airways to update this plane or to only use it for shorter trips. It is just simply too out of date for this time of trip and is not fair to customers.",0.0019673128,0.00026984452,0.01299947,0.12095432,0.029801648,0.0111823585,0.001595356,0.000836617,0.0012489746,0.2070928,0.12011224,0.0077097192,0.007353598,0.0008097641,0.00075253873,0.006644278,0.0042447927,0.0045170425,0.00023996514,0.0013816415,0.0052224584,0.0024326192,0.024476744,0.012529371,0.039916933,0.07193237,0.0006136213,0.2515648,neutral,0.2515648,disappointment,0.2070928,annoyance,0.12095432

Had a 20 minute delay, but despite that, no other negatives. The airplane was very new and clean and Cabin Crew were very kind and welcoming. Welcome drinks made the beginning of the flight pleasant. The new entertainment system for Turkish Airlines was very nice with good movies and music even though I would have liked a wider music selection. Food was fabulous, and seat reclined into a full bed.
