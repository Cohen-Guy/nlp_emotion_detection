It seems seats in the last row in PE have better recline than the other two rows. Seats arranged in 2x3x2 configuration. Seat with foot rest, fairly comfortable with good recline. PE cabin completely full. Shared bathrooms with economy cabin. IFE screens good size maybe 11 or 12 inches seem a little larger than iPad. Good contents plenty to watch to kill time. Cabin clean and tidy, bathrooms kept fully stocked and clean. Flight scheduled to depart Hong Kong at 10:20 AM but delayed to 10:35 AM and finally departed after 11am. Arrived into Melbourne after 11pm about 40 minutes late. Pre departure drinks offered but no champagne only water and juices. Hot towel offered only once be nice to have another hot towel service prior to arrival. Once airborne lunch service began. Pre ordered vegetarian meal and served first but after finished with meal stuck with tray for the next hour as cabin crew was serving the rest of the economy cabin before returning to clear trays. Drinks offered multiple times. A male cabin crew addressed passengers by name and introduced himself, very pleasant and professional. Pre arrival meals served two hours before landing. Overall an above average flight with friendly and professional cabin crew. Only minor complaint Cathay Pacific does not know the different between vegan and vegetarian meals. If you order vegetarian meal chances are you will get a vegan meal of pasta with salad and no dressing for main meal and some sort of greasy grilled vegetables with soggy potato wedges as pre landing meal.

A chaotic check in experience for a packed flight at CDG. Boarding was supposed to be via zone, but when boarding time came at CDG it was every man for himself. Basically it was organized chaos. Passengers boarded with hand luggage that did not fit into the overhead compartments, and I ended up helping the cabin crew repack the compartments to fit everything in, as I am quite tall. The flight from CDG to ADD was the noisiest, smelliest flight I have ever been on, and 4 hours into the 6.5 hour journey, I wanted to use the toilet. The floor and toilet was covered in urine and toilet paper. I reported this to the cabin crew and nothing was done about it. The interior was the the most tired and dated I have been on, and my inflight entertainment was working on and off. Food service was abysmal, and after service the crew disappeared for the rest of the flight. The aircraft was quite dirty and one of the overhead bins opened in ADD when we were slammed into the ground upon landing. The leg from ADD to JNB was also in a 777-200LR, but on the upside it was quite empty. Meal service on this leg was a snack and a lunch and from all the meals this was passable. Service in general was OK, but nothing to rave about. In general the whole Ethiopian experience left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I would suggest that the airline focus on customer service, and do something to fix abysmal ADD airport before they consider expanding further. A more modern cabin refresh wouldn't hurt either.",0.018915577,0.0035291307,0.036928494,0.07330226,0.08243276,0.02116483,0.013805936,0.0081876805,0.006269722,0.025176287,0.057523914,0.011225597,0.00205878,0.010205526,0.006314582,0.0015856011,8.780978e-05,0.0067019537,0.0028891067,0.0008112427,0.015802015,0.00027669573,0.027893651,0.0008002017,0.0006680878,0.011239024,0.0098088235,0.5443947,neutral,0.5443947,approval,0.08243276,annoyance,0.07330226

I consider this flight an excellent choice for having sufficient time in the morning in Christchurch to have brunch with family before flying home. Check in effortless at Christchurch Airport. Made use of Koru Lounge prior to boarding with Koru membership. Boarding quick. Aircraft perhaps 85% full. Once loaded, an unexpected 30 minute delay occurred. However, flight landed in Brisbane 15 minutes early. The only male flight attendant presented as disinterested, appearing unhappy and 'going through the motions.' Female flight attendants were positively engaged in their occupation. Food offerings consisted of two hot meals for 'The Works' passengers. The beef, rice and vegetable option was tasty enough for airline food. However portion small. It has been noted on a number of Air New Zealand flights taken recently that soft drinks are not served by the can, but rather out of the can and into the plastic cup by the flight attendants. While innocent in service to passengers, this is portion control by any description and therefore Air New Zealand cost cutting. I have also noticed that when the Customer Service Manager reads the offerings out across the PA, there is no mention of soft drinks, only tea, coffee and water. Bags out on belt within 15 minutes at Brisbane Airport. While I consider Air New Zealand to be a good airline, they pale in comparison to Qantas with service delivery.

The New York to Chicago flight was nice trip and bumpy so service was suspended for safety reasons. Chicago to Vancouver a nasty air crew looking to upset customers. We sat in the third row or first of premium economy. We were ordered shortly after take off not to congregate or line up for toilets in the rear. Since we were up front making it to the toilet without anyone getting in front of you was impossible. Due to this fact I did not drink on aircraft as at 65 it can be painful to wait. We were offered no food as promised for our two hungry boys. They did get a third of a can of Sprite as this was their second long flight they asked for another drink of Sprite. They were refused. My wife asked for water instead politely. I asked for the purser to request an additional sprite as United advertises complimentary beverages. He did deliver. I thanked him profusely but now I was unbeknownst to me a marked man. I sat quietly until I was in dire need of a toilet. There were eight people in first class all sitting comfortably so I quickly used the front toilet. You would think I had threatened the aircraft. When I exited I was berated and demeaned by that same purser and ordered back to my seat. Where else I would go at 36,000 feet in the air was a mystery to me. I complied without incident. I did tell him quietly before landing he was a rude man for embarrassing me for using a toilet. On arrival the pilot came bounding out of the cockpit and had requested security at the gate. A toilet offense had apparently endangered the aircraft in some ridiculous fashion. He proceeded to lie about me talking to staff which had not happened. I was accused of blocking the aisle which had not happened. The security personnel dismissed the incident and we all went home.

We paid extra for the elite plus package. The 3rd row we had on the way down was ideal. We got the first row on the way back, it was the worst, you couldnâ€™t move the arm rest and itâ€™s annoying to have no place to put your bags. On the way down, we had a rowdy, loud couple who never stopped talking. It was annoying until around 11pm and just ignorant after that as it would have been nice to have a little nap given we werenâ€™t getting to our hotel until 3-4am. The flight attendants did nothing to get them to be quiet, rather, they participated in the shenanigans. If I had my kids with me, I would have been extremely upset. On the way back, the same couple was on the plane and were still talking the whole way home. We left Cuba after 3am so everyone wanted to sleep and these people never shut up. Again, no one from sunwing said anything to them. Grow a back bone for your other passengers flight comfort and say something to these people please! As for the resort, it was amazing. However, Sunwing was paid by us for a 7 day stay. We really got more like 6 and a few hours because of the time our flight came in. I would recommend you ask Sunwing about this. Our check in time for our resort was 3pm March 2nd. We hadnâ€™t even left Edmonton until 5:45pm that same day. Our flight home was at 3:35am on March 10th. We had to vacate our room at 12pm on March 9th meaning we had no room to stay in for 11 hours before the bus came to take us to the airport. When we spoke to the resort, they said sometimes when Sunwing does this, they pay for the room or negotiate late check out. They did nothing of the sort. The resort however took care of us and we checked out at 4pm and were offered a courtesy room in case we wanted to freshen up before the flight. That was 100% because we spoke to a wonderful man named Oscar who helps run the resort. When I went to the front desk, they basically said thatâ€™s what sunwing paid for so if we hadnâ€™t found Oscar, we would have been screwed. Iâ€™ve stayed once in Cuba before and had the exact same flight situation but we got to keep our room until we left. This is why I will book through that company in the future. Iâ€™ve had so many issues with Sunwing that I havenâ€™t booked with them in 4 years and I never will again.

no,1,1,2,1,1,2,1,flydubai,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,2022,2,737-800MAX,,,Dubai,Zanzibar,,False," We had booked a return flight with Emirates, from Glasgow to Zanzibar via Dubai on 27th February and returning on 7th March. After confirming our booking, we found that the 6 hour leg from Dubai to Zanzibar is operated by FlyDubai, which turns out to be a low cost (but not particularly cheap) airline. The Emirates flights to and from Glasgow to Dubai on a 777-300 were excellent in all respects but we can honestly say that in all our years of travelling, the FlyDubai flights in a Boeing 737-800MAX were probably the worst we have ever taken. By booking with Emirates, we not unreasonably expected to get at least a roughly comparable standard of service and amenities. We believe that Emirates should make it clearer when booking that an associated connecting flight is operated by a budget airline, and a poor one at that. There were so many things wrong that itâ€™s difficult to know where to start but here goes: The seats were really very cramped, with a nominal pitch of 30â€ but I suspect that in reality itâ€™s a bit less than this. Furthermore, the seats were quite hard and our backsides started to suffer after a couple of hours. Theyâ€™ve tried to cram in as many passengers as possible and whilst this may be just bearable for short haul flights, itâ€™s a disgrace to use this configuration for what was a long haul flight. It was obvious that many passengers, and more especially the taller ones, were really suffering. The aisle was very narrow, and passengers in aisle seats were being constantly bumped into while trying to sleep. The cabin on both the outbound and return flights was terribly stuffy and airless. Air con was either not working properly, or not set up correctly. People were asking for water but had to pay for it! Absolutely disgraceful! As we were on an Emirates ticket, we were entitled to complimentary meals, but other passengers had to pay. The meals were truly awful and pretty much inedible. In flight entertainment is available but has to be paid for, even for those on an Emirates ticket. FlyDubai operates from Terminal 2 which entails a painfully slow 40 minute bus transfer from Terminal 3 â€“ this is pretty nail-biting if you have a tight connection, as we did. All in all, a horrible experience that we never wish to repeat and we can categorically state that we will never use FlyDubai again, and nor will we book with Emirates if they use them for connecting flights.

London Heathrow to Dubai started off well as I only had hand luggage so getting to gate was a breeze thanks to Emirates easy and intuitive mobile check-in. It all went downhill from here though. On boarding was clear my ICE seat back screen was not working or responding. Worse it wouldn't switch off and kept flickering. I informed a member of the cabin crew about the issue but there wasn't a lot of enthusiasm or effort made to help. I asked if could be switched off if it could not be made to work, and never heard anything for the rest of the flight leaving me with flickering screen to contend with for 8 hours which was distracting and didn't really help me sleep on a night flight. I understand things go wrong and am reasonable but its how you handle things that matters. Once over Dubai, landing was delayed and we were put in holding pattern for 1.5 hours due to fog. We were informed that ground staff would be on hand to help those with missed connections and those that had tight ones to make and I was relieved at first to see a lot of staff about. However it seemed they were only helping certain people and when I asked, I got yelled at very disrespecftfully to go look at the departure board. I was left to fend for myself when I only had 20 minutes to get my gate for the flight to Dhaka which was showing as ""Final Call"". Infuriated and out of breath I arrived at the gate just in time to be met with a surly and unapologetic gate staff. I was then shoved on bus in the Dubai heat and we were left there for half an hour without any updates past take-off time. We were then bussed to the cargo terminal where our plane was parked and boarded and then left for a further 45 minutes without much information. The saving grace of the DXB-DAC sector was the crew were quite friendly and warm, and unusually the catering was rather nice. Returning DAC-DXB, even getting into the aiport was a nightmare due the corruption and difficulties that have returned with using Dhaka airport and the use of the local airlines Biman handling team is slow and innefficient. The hassling for money of my elderly mother from her requested assistance was also unwelcome. The flight itself DAC-DXB was uneventful, but the food was atrocious even by Emirates standards - almost inedible. Thas was repeated on the DXB-NCL sector as well. All in all very much going downhill, even the hard product is showing some weariness and there's complacency in improvements on these - the 10 abreast seating on Boeing 777's is horrific. Staff attitude has always been their weak point but it has got particularly bad to the point of contempt, especially when things go wrong.

I was really disappointed with Aer Lingus because the plane was incredibly uncomfortable. It was the first flight in years where actually sitting in the seats was deeply uncomfortable. And I do mean seats. I had to move twice as my first seat had a broken headphone connection, the second seat was in a weird location with fixed sides so I couldn't move my hips at all and twisted my back. I was surprised by how many people had major issues with their entertainment screen and I was surprised by how poor it was. The touchscreen was more like ""hit it 4 or 5 times"" screen and watch it go to the wrong thing. I had to use the remote to navigate and it still did not register after 3 times of hitting the button. I gave up after one show because the headphones (a double prong jack so I couldn't use my own headphones) sounded like people talking into a tin can. Everything felt so outdated. I spent a good time out of my seat toward the end of the flight trying to help my back recover.

First time flying BA after flying Qatar, Emirates and Oman Air business class. Check in at BAH was quick and efficient with their seperate business and first class check in area. BA uses the Dilmun lounge, which is basic but adequate. The flight from BAH to LHR was on a 777. The seats are in a 2x4x2 configuration and are very narrow (similar to premium economy seats, and marginally larger than the economy seats) though reasonably comfortable. When fully flat there is not much room, and people over 6 feet will struggle. There was hardly any storage space, and the IFE screen was very small and of poor quality. The food was very average (I had the carrot and pumpkin soup). Cabin crew was disengaged and the plane felt old and tired. The lounge in Heathrow is large, but gets too busy to be able to sit comfortably. The bathrooms in both the main BA lounges are quite dated and need a good clean far more often then they get. The quality of food in the lounge is average, though the wine and spirit selection is decent. The flight from LHR to BOS was on a 747 and this was similar to the 777 - old and tired with cramped seating for business class. Cabin crew were a bit better on this leg, though still disengaged. The food was of average quality, though the wine list, while small, was good. Overall, BA has the feel of a budget carrier compared to some of its middle eastern counterparts. The lounge is sub par, particularly when compared to the Qatar lounge in Doha, or even the Qantas / One World lounge in LAX. The business class ticket was reasonably cheap, though I can now see why.

I like Vienna airport for it is small, efficient and convenient. Austrian Airlines is exactly the same. On this 8+ hour night flight from Toronto to Vienna I had a very memorable experience. Because of the change of equipment from what I expected, I ended up sitting in row 7 which has no window. I wasnâ€™t happy! But since it was a night flight and I was going to sleep for most of it I thought I wonâ€™t make a fuss. During dinner service, when the flight attendant asked me if everything was OK, I said yes, adding that it would be great if she could do something about the missing window - jokingly. Well, when I woke up in the morning I look up, and on the wall where the window was supposed to be I had a painting of a window with a beautiful sunrise drawn on it in vibrant colours. Along with a very sweet note from the flight attendant that was serving me. Made my flight! That is attention to detail.

IFE was good, just lack options and as for the Cabin Crew, no one really stood out.

With the exception of the size of the lavatory and the ground crew in Auckland during transit, I could not nitpick anything. I was pleasantly surprised how great the seats were for length. The lavatory lacked space and was just as cramped as any economy toilet and one member of ground staff decided to get on the phone about one thing while I was boarding holding me up. The manager did come over and tell her to hurry up as it's delaying boarding, but it was frustrating having to wait for what sounded a pointless call. But besides those two things.

yes,9,4,5,4,3,4,4,Air Canada rouge,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,2022,9,767-300,,,YYZ,EDI,,True," I have just completed my 10th flight with Air Canada rouge in their premium rouge class. I have never tried rouge or rouge plus offerings therefore I cannot comment on them. I have used premium rouge every year over the Toronto - Edinburgh route since they started in 2013. All flights have been on their B767-300. Rouge is ACs Leisure airline with lower operating costs than mainline AC, it is not advertised as a low cost carrier. It is however clearly advertised on the AC web site as a different product to mainline AC. My tip would be to do some research before you travel. On this trip I checked in at Bermuda as I was on a through ticket BDA/YYZ/EDI. Boarding at YYZ followed the standard AC arrangements with premium rouge passengers boarding in group 2. I was given a warm welcome on board having been recognized by a crew member from a previous rouge flight. The seat has similar pitch and width to those used on AC mainline business class service in N. America. (Including Bermuda & Caribbean) Each premium passenger had a small overnight amenity kit and bottled water on the seat waiting for them. Tablets for the rouge IFE system were handed out by FAs prior to departure. The use of these is included in the premium package. Departure from YYZ was a couple of minutes early and once in the air dinner menus were handed out. There was a choice of two main dishes. The drinks and meal service appeared much more professional in its presentation and co-ordination than it was in the â€˜earlyâ€™ days of rouge. The table ware is exactly the same as in ACs N. American business having experienced this on the earlier BDA/YYZ sector. The only issue on the flight was an un-serviceable washroom at the front of the plane. We were directed to use the facility mid-cabin. One of these, clearly for use by disabled passengers, was the biggest aircraft washroom I have every used.

The food served for dinner was a mixture of good and mediocre. Warm salmon on ice cold salad is never a pleasant experience. The seats in First are reasonably comfortable although they lack the privacy of competitors' premium cabin. The duvet was made redundant because of the typically overheated cabin. One of the First toilets was out of action so we had to make use of the Club World loos upstairs. It would have been helpful if cabin crew had apologised for the inconvenience for the lack of the convenience, but no comment was made. The IFE was passable and the sound quality good if one's own noise cancelling headphones are used. WiFi was available but I didn't make use of it.

Flew from Santiago de Compostela on Iberia Express to Madrid yesterday to connect to our Iberia flight to New York. I can see why Iberia Express gets its 'most punctual airline' reputation. Boarding was swift, very organized and we departed about 5mins ahead of schedule. On board, sadly there wasn't much to say except the legroom was very tight and even a coffee had to be paid for. The crew seemed pleasant and helpful. I was however, not able to connect to the advertised free streaming entertainment at all. Not a huge deal breaker as it was a short flight. I had decided to take up an email offer to upgrade my next sector to New York and was so glad I did. Having priority boarding as a part of it was a huge plus on this maxed out A340-600. I loved the Premium Economy seat with the extra recline and legroom was great. It's a fresh, relatively small, more private cabin than the wild expanse of regular economy. The larger, responsive, IFE screen worked well and had just enough options to keep me occupied for 7 hours. The very slightly upgraded meal (main served in a china dish) was fairly decent thought it took quite a while after take off before it was served. There was no bar service before this. The crew were warm and pleasant though and seemed to be constantly working. We sat in row 15 which is only slightly ahead of the galley, so could hear everything and the light from the galley was distracting at times. The pre-arrival snack of a boxed sandwich was fine and we arrived only slightly late into JFK. All in all, I'd recommend Iberia's Premium Economy if you do get an email offer to upgrade.

As they are launching their flight to BOG and CLO, KLM are offering both Dutch and Colombian typical fare almost unedible. Nice amenity kits, good IFE and duty free sales. Smooth connections at AMS, despite our luggage being delayed for one day in the outbound leg, due to our short connection.

I was looking forward to this flight - it was Saturday so no work the following day and 62K on the upper deck used to be such a treat! I have read many reviews recently of BA falling behind the competition so my expectations were low - but even these were beaten by this overall truly awful experience. Firstly I have to say the crew on the flight were super in every way. Nothing was too much trouble and they seemed to genuinely be enjoying their work. I should have given my 'BA Golden Ticket' to one of them but forgot. However no matter how good the crew, it cannot make up for everything else being totally awful and shabby. The seat was filthy with what looked like ketchup from the previous flight and crumbs everywhere. Not a nice start. The aircraft was very very old - a lot of the interior was patched up with white gum. The IFE didn't work properly. Amenity kit was a bag and the headsets poor quality. The toilets (compared to AA) were small unpleasant. Seat is not up to most Business class standard. Food was awful and the 'club kitchen' almost non-existent. These days I would choose AA (or Delta, United, Virgin) any day over BA.

Previously flew the A359 and the business seats on the 773 was a bit of a letdown compared to the fantastic newer product (it's a shame if the rumors are true that CX will change the business seats of the 359). Nonetheless, the reverse herringbone layout allows for great privacy and the seat provides numerous storage options for large and small items. Catering was better than the first leg with very responsive service and very unobtrusive for those who want to sleep. Special mention to the chief purser who made the service a joy. IFE was a bit of a letdown as well, but I suppose it was just that the selection of movies, while extensive, did not contain those that appealed to me. On the return leg, the company messed up the connecting day which was resolved very quickly on the ground in ORD. In-flight service to HKG and MNL was more robotic and less warm. They have a good business product, but for an Asian airline, I think it could up its game a little bit to play with the other big boys in the region (Singapore, ANA, Asiana).",0.32400256,0.015917165,0.013559233,0.024156002,0.112198584,0.015194473,0.0061028283,0.0056684567,0.006334751,0.010438119,0.02288543,0.0041414597,0.001065362,0.027670268,0.0035891628,0.016867097,8.665715e-05,0.038059343,0.027537564,0.00054743676,0.03257478,0.00044058752,0.020462424,0.00095846603,0.00032911162,0.004961131,0.009759422,0.25449207,admiration,0.32400256,neutral,0.25449207,approval,0.112198584

First off, they cancelled my original flight home. So, I had to spend an extra night in Lisbon, which was actually a little fun. I got to walk around Lisbon, and I had a great dinner. TAP covered the hotel bill and it was okay. With that said, they promised to cover us for dinner, which never happened, but breakfast was included. They also provided transport. As for the flights, they could have been better. Food was so so, but you could get free beer or wine. Seats were uncomfortable. Also, beware of paying extra for seats. They switched airplanes on my flight to Lisbon, and didn't bother to switch my seat to the emergency row-even thought I paid 65 Euro for it. In the end, I got an emergency row seat, but not the one I wanted and paid for. On the way back to America, I got the proper emergency row seat, but the in-flight entertainment didn't work for me, despite several attempts to reset it. With this all in mind, the flights did fly on time, and my flight back to the US was early, which helped with my connection. All things considered, I would not fly this airline again if I can help it. Too much trouble, and I was one of the lucky ones. I was part of a tour of Morocco where everyone flew TAP, and many people were out hundreds of dollars with the one-day delayed flight.

The good thing is that they are fully flat, the bad thing is that they do not all offer direct aisle access (and that there are 3 seats together in the middle row in business class). That said, I also have to say that the Buenos Aires - Istanbul flight is very long because of the stop in Sao Paulo, but flying business class in TK makes it seem shorter, the IFE is quite good and the food is great. I take this flight twice a year and even though the food service deteriorated a bit lately, it is still very good compared to other airlines (unfortunately on my last flights there was no more amuse bouche, no more many options of starters to pick from the trolley and no more final trolley with coffee and petit fours-the latter was now consolidated with the dessert trolley, also the champagne on board was downgraded from Taittinger to Mumm). As I said the meals service is still good but it could be a lot better if flight attendants would be more proactive at offering drinks and refills. They just do not do it, you need to call them every time you need a refill (it does not happen in many other airlines) and when you do they take forever and it is obvious are not willing to do it. Overall, I would recommend TK business class because the food is very good and the seats are confortable, but they need to improve the service on board.

You must be comming earlier. When it was 17:30 pm, there was a sign on departure schedule board: Dubai FZ780: departure 23:00. No one came to us, no info what is happening etc. After my asking to airport staff I was answered that there is a thick fog at DXB airport (but plane is from 15:30 at Prague airport). FlyDubai supervisor wasnÂ´t at her office and no one could reach her. No official info from flydubai representative. It was a really poor apology and answer about the fog. Turkish airlines, Emirates with the big airbus, SwissAir, SmartWings and many other flights from PRG to DXB were departing and the flights from DXB were landing in PRG. But only FlyDubai customers were sitting on the floor in a hall and waiting hours for new information. I have checked the weather radar at DXB airport from my notebook and the visibility was from 8km to 10km. After another complaining, I got the phone number to flydubai representative help line. No answer, just automatic speech (Thank you for your calling to flydubai, for communication in english press 1 and my call was automaticly cancelled). Help line didnÂ´t help at all. Finally at 22:00 a new schedule of Dubai departure showed PRG to DXB FZ780 FlyDubai: 1:00 am 1st January 2017. I was so upset and annoyed. I realized that my business, hotel reservation and New YearÂ´s firework are totally buried. I wanted my money back and wanted to cancel the journey. When I reached the flydubai representative, I was told that no cancellation is available due to weather conditions. I asked the captain with his crew who were just passing us and arrived to PRG from Africa with stop on DXB and continuing to PRG and he told us, that it is nice and sunny in DXB without any problems. The representative of flydubai told us after this, that pilots need to have a rest and will not fly. After protests of other passangers, they gave us 10 dollars ticket for refreshment, but in Duty free zone there was everything closed because of the New YearÂ´s Eve. At midnight a member of airport came to business lounge and said: The lounge closes normally at 19:00 and it is 24:00 now. Go to the counters down to the hall to the others. Small kids, infants, old people, no matter. At 1:00am next day departure schedule board shows FlyDubai FZ780 to DXB planned departure 7:00 morning. Flight delayed 18 hrs in total, no hotel (they said none available), no refreshment, no help, no info, no more flydubai.",0.10640152,0.02275402,0.015494158,0.03139273,0.0870591,0.01782393,0.012394451,0.010142684,0.006962185,0.011565653,0.023936426,0.0042186007,0.0012275486,0.02601968,0.0037015486,0.17896894,0.00014224644,0.050935436,0.015498515,0.00073744537,0.049121805,0.00066018524,0.021086155,0.0016175511,0.0004007565,0.0047353986,0.00835341,0.28664795,neutral,0.28664795,gratitude,0.17896894,admiration,0.10640152

Shortly after take-off the service began. There were 2 food options available. Chicken and vegatarian lasagne, I went for the Lasagne which was ok, nothing special. It came with a salad, a bread bun and a black forest cake. All in all an ok meal, nothing to complain about. The crew distributed 2 mini cans of soda which was a bit unsatisfying. After dinner the crew dimmed the lights and we were supposed to close the window shades for the people who wanted to sleep. I tried to watch some movies (the selection was ok) which was hard on this miniature IFE. In the morning the crew served orange juice and before landing a pretzel with cheese and a small water bottle. Connecting in Heathrow is pretty easy (in T5) there are signs everywhere!

Yes, Spirit charges 2 dollars for bottomless coffee and 2 dollars for a bottle of water. I think I can live with that. I've seen a review where a traveler paid a little over 100 dollars for a flight but ended up spending 600 with ""hidden"" fees - there are no hidden fees. All their fees are advertised on the website. If I occasionally do need to check a bag, I pay 26 dollars each way (at time of booking). It's a few dollars more afterward.
